1,1,I’ve had this for a year now after my last pot wore out. Love it!,5,2018-10-26,,True,,Love it!,,
2,1,My husband and I really like this coffee maker.  We leave for work about three hours apart so it’s really nice having the single pot feature for the weekdays and the full pot feature for the weekends.  Very easy to clean. I like that you can use your own coffee instead of having a buy a non-eco-friendly kureg pod.,5,2018-10-23,,True,,My husband and I really like this coffee maker,,
3,1,Great,5,2018-10-22,,True,,Great,,
4,1,"Horrible. Bought this coffee maker during a move. First time that I used it, the water didn’t hold in the reservoir and went everywhere. Since I was moving, I missed the return period. What a waste of money.",1,2018-10-20,,True,,Horrible.,,

6,1,"The negative:  it’s very slow, especially if you’re waiting on a whole pot but even the single cup seems very slow.  Considering how slow you’d think the coffee would be super hot but it’s not that hot.  There is no sound when it’s done, the light just clicks off. So you really aren’t notified you just have to stand there and wait.  Also no notification when the warmer goes off.<br /><br />The positive:  I really enjoy the single cup option.",3,2018-09-11,,True,,Needs improvement but works,,

After arriving with a broken carafe that took two weeks to replace, the 12 cup brewing side has now died.  Probably hasn't been used more than 30 times as I mostly brew single cups.

16,1,good machine for replacing Keurig non-biodegradable k cups in the landfill  coffee make -  we have a decaf drinker and a can you make it stronger regular drinker so I thought this one cup on the side brew was a good idea -  two things -  the one cup brew doe not use filters and the coffee is full of grounds -  I have tried coarse grind and medium grind -  just cant get it right -  and secondly - the coffee does not get as hot as a keurig -  I  usually have to put it in the microwave to heat it up -  I am keeping this - but wish it was easier,1,2017-06-20,,True,,Good concept - but not as efficient as I had hoped,,
17,1,"This is a really good coffeemaker. The secondary single-serve is a great feature and works flawlessly. I especially like the Senseo coffee pods. We bought this to replace our Keurig because we were tired of spending a small fortune on k-cups every month and contributing so much plastic to the landfill. This gives us the best of both and if I drink more than a pot of coffee, I don't have to make another pot.",5,2015-04-13,,True,,"Great coffeemaker, excellent value",,
18,1,"This coffee maker is the best! We've had it for a few months and have experienced no problems. We're a family of serious coffee-drinkers and everyone raves about this brewer. We like that we can brew a single cup, jumbo-sized mug, or travel mug and customize it to our specific strength and use any ground coffee for our desired flavor. We do brew full pots and we love the programmable start so that we can have a pot ready for us when we get home from church. We're up and out at different times during the week, though, so the single-cup brewing is great for us when a full pot would go to waste. This unit does NOT use K-cups, but it's much more economical because the single-brew mesh filter allows for any coffee you like, without the over-priced single brew cups. Before buying this product, I also looked at the Ninja Coffee Bar, which was more than twice the price of the Hamilton Beach maker. I'm so happy with the Hamilton Beach 49980A and glad I didn't waste money on the Ninja.",5,2017-01-25,,True,,Love this coffee maker!,,

21,1,"I returned it without using, so this review is based on what I saw. Best price for an option that can do both a full size and a single cup. But the top black plastic part is SO CHEAP that pieces broke before it got to me. However, the pieces that broke would not have been a huge deal in use (you'd have to hold up the piece so you could pour water in). SO - I think if you got a really good deal on it, I'd recommend it! Just don't be irritated when you realize parts are cheap.",3,2017-04-05,,True,,OK but,,
22,1,"I bought this to replace my Keirig, because I wanted to be less wasteful. This coffee maker was a joke. I almost wonder if the reviews were bought, because it hardly worked from day 1.

25,1,"Since purchasing the Coffee maker it has performed perfectly and makes great coffee in both the single and 12 cup side.  The water is easy to fill and pour without spilling, unlike my previous brand.  Tried using K cups instead of the pods just for grins.  It is a tight fit with the K cup and I would say that even if you puncture the top that it wouldn't work right.  I would not recommend it for K Cups.  Either use the Pods or a single scoop of coffee in the built in fine filter.",5,2016-05-27,,True,,Excellent Coffee maker for single cup and 12 cups.,,

46,1,"I received this coffee pot and an early Christmas present. I generally host all of our family parties. This coffee pot is perfect for those get togethers. I can make a pot of coffee for those who want coffee and then I can make single cups of hot water for tea or hot chocolate. I love the program option. I get everything ready at night and its ready when I get up. I've had the unit since the end of November. The hot plate has slowly started to look bad. Below is a picture. I'm nervous to keep using it with the excessive wear. I feel it's a fire hazard. I contacted Hamilton Beach. They informed me that &#34;<br />Thank you for contacting us.

48,1,"I am very pleased with this coffee maker. I was previously used a very high priced Krupp coffee/expresó maker. I loved the machine but my oldest broke the coffee pot side of the system. He really needed a single serving maker. I loved my Lattes, but I needed to find something better for the family. After a little Google research I felt pushed to get this Hamilton Beach model. Great unit! Makes single servings and pots. The coffee tastes great and best of all, pouring from the pot does not drip off the sides of the pot. I thought there was not solution to pouring from a full pot without having it drip off the pot. Thank you Hamilton Beach engineers for designing a pot that doesn't need to be poured over the sink to avoid a mess.",5,2017-06-25,,True,,I am very pleased with this coffee maker,,
49,1,"Purchased for my husband to try and wean him off the KUERIG, which I learned to despise because I think it is wasteful and expensive. I saw that ithis  made a single serving into his travel cup so this feature got my attention. We have had since October and I think he likes it. The programmable feature is nice. I think we still waste coffee, but I think we still spend less on coffee than with the Keurig machines, which we have had many over the years.",4,2016-12-18,,True,,"Purchased for my husband to try and wean him off the KUERIG,",,
50,1,Works great in both single-cup mode or in whole-pot mode.  It does take some trick to figure out how much to grind the beans and how much to put in to the single-cup side.  In the beginning I had some spill-overs of coffee grounds into the cup.  Now I measure out 2 tablespoons and it's perfect every time!  I usually brew directly into a standard coffee mug (the platform raises up so it doesn't splash) and love getting every cup of coffee super-fresh.,5,2017-01-06,,True,,Great by the cup or by the pot!,,
51,1,"This machine is designed to use coffee (or tea) &#34;pods&#34; to make single servings.  Each pod is good for a weak 6 oz cup of coffee.  If you prefer stronger coffee (like Starbucks, or Peets) you will need to use at least two pods for each 6 oz cup.<br />Pods are available through several vendors, but selections are relatively limited, and (considering that fact that one may need to use two pods for each 6 oz cup) they are somewhat expensive.<br /><br />A nice feature is that you can also make single servings using &#34;loose&#34; medium-ground coffee.  This will get coffee to the desired strength, but there tends to be a good deal of sediment in each cup.<br /><br />The full size pot does a nice job.  It has a &#34;bold&#34; setting that slows down the brewing cycle but yields nice strong coffee.",3,2014-01-11,4.0,True,,Pods are useless,,
52,1,"Really love this coffee maker. My husband likes to make the coffee for morning after dinner for the timer operation. Sometimes I want a cup of coffee after he has already set the coffee maker up for morning. I can easily do this with the single cup side.<br />My only complaint is that the pot doesn't have an adjustment to 3 hours for shut off. It automatically shuts off at 2 hours. However, that being said, if you just hit start, it heats the coffee in the pot up to very hot in about 10 minutes after shutting off.",4,2016-03-05,2.0,True,,Really Love this coffee maker.,,
53,1,"We're coffeeholics and we replace our coffee maker about every year, whether it needs it or not. This one performs as well as any of the higher priced trendy brands that we've purchased in the past. We got this one specifically because it has the single serve option on the side for using K cups.  That combined with a 12 cup carafe made it just the right machine for us. Maybe not as convenient as some of the machines that do K cups, because with this one you need to empty the K cup contents into the bronze screen filter basket, to get a good strong cup of joe. It's an easy task though and not messy at all. I would definitely recommend it to a friend and wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one. We'll see how it holds out over the long term, about a month and a half so far and it's performing perfectly.",5,2014-09-08,,True,,to get a good strong cup of joe,,
54,1,"One day last month (Jan. 2018), I went to make a pot of coffee. Filled up the reservoir, added the filter and grounds, pressed the power button, and went into the other room to do something else. I realized sometime later that I wasn’t hearing it’s normal percolating sounds, so I returned and found the pot was still empty and stone cold! So I knew it was time for a new coffee maker!<br /><br />I really like this coffee maker! I've never had any experience with the single-serve units out today, but, when I saw that I could have one such pot and a 12-cup pot in one product for a reasonable price, I bought it. And I’m glad I did. I enjoy being able to brew twelve pots to have ready throughout the day when I’m not at work, but, on mornings when I’m running late, I like being able to flip the switch to Single Brew and just fill up a cup.<br /><br />For the single brew side, you can brew up to a 14-ounce cup/travel mug. If you do smaller, such as 10 ounces, there’s a little stand to raise your cup closer to the drip. If you have a travel mug (14 ounce), you don’t need the boost. When not in use, the stand turns upside down in order to fit into the unit, camouflaged. It has a separate reservoir and a separate filter for the single-serve side.<br /><br />For the 12-cup side, you get a sturdy pot and a separate reservoir/filter.<br /><br />This product also comes with a small supply of filters, but a word of caution: The first two times I brewed coffee using these filters, there were coffee grounds in the brew. At first, I didn’t know to lay the blame on the filters, but when I changed it the second time, I noticed how the grounds rose higher than the filter. So I tried using the filters for our old pot and brewed a grounds-free pot of coffee. I don’t know why the filters provided aren’t the right size for the filter basket, but, if you use their filters, don’t be surprised if there are grounds in your pot.<br /><br />Other than the short filters, I can’t find a thing wrong with this coffee maker. It’s wider than my old 12-cup maker, but it doesn’t take up too much more room on the counter. Another feature is the option to make a stronger pot of coffee (which I haven’t used) by pressing Brew. The 12-cup pot also stays hot for two hours after it’s brewed.<br /><br />All in all, I’m glad I bought this product.",5,2018-02-01,4.0,True,,A Great Purchase!,,
55,1,"I had been enjoying this coffee maker for a year & two months.  It's design & the to go brew had been convenient.  I even liked how my stainless steel to go cup fit perfectly in the single brew space for storage.  BUT I was extremely disappointed when I realized the reason my coffee wasn't ready when I woke up for work this morning, was that the clock for programming the wake alarm is only in PM now!  I rolled thru the clock multiple times & there is no AM option anymore to set my wake up brew.  I have tried multiple tests/settings for the automatic brew in PM & it just doesn't work at all anymore!  Having a programmable clock to set a timer is one of the main reasons why I purchased this coffee maker.  You would think a coffee maker in this price range would last longer then a year & two months.  The programmable clock function is so important to me that I will now need to buy another coffee machine. (The Mr. Coffee machine I had before this one lasted me 5 years & that was $20 cheaper!  Hopefully I can find that one again.)  So I bought this machine in November 2016, I've had it for One year & two months.  I just checked the warranty, which is (of course) One year.  I will reach out to the company despite being two months over on the warranty just to see what they say.

I basically only the single serve side since I'm the only one in my house who drinks coffee and I only need 2 cups per serving. Overall, it works as advertised. The single serve side fills my 2 cup mug in probably 4-5 minutes. Not sure if there are drip machines that can do this quicker..? My one complaint is that I can't purchase a new permanent filter for the single serve side. It's still in decent shape but I figure at some point it will need replaced since it's used and rinsed daily. A Hamilton Beach rep told me they don't sell these at all. I'm currently searching third party sites for this filter. Hamilton Beach, perhaps you should include a few extra permanent filters with your new coffee makers!

79,1,"I drink a lot of coffee, and all my coffee pots are extremely important to me. I went from Cuisinart coffee pot that ground the beans for you at the time of brewing. It was amazing until six year of everyday or more brewing it broke. I also had a Cuisinart before that, that ground the coffee for five years. But my husband tired of the grinding noise in the morning. So I looked into a coffee pot that would brew a pot or a cup depending on your need. Since, we have visitors that sometimes request just an afternoon brew.<br /><br />I had to have this pot, because the single cup side had a reusable filter and I am not willing to be wasteful on those popular pods for coffee brewing. Not to mention they are expensive and I want to control the grounds. I like fine grinds for a strono cup.<br /><br />I bought this with a separate grinder and my husband and I are both happy. I grind the coffee the night before and program the pot for my delicious morning coffee. I use the pot side daily and the cup side from time to time. It is my new favorite coffee pot.<br /><br />FYI, some review mention the cup side splattering, but a brief run though in the instructions shows that you can raise the cup. No splatter and a super hot cup of Joe will be waiting. I would say, great buy!",5,2014-06-07,3.0,True,,For Coffee Lovers,,
80,1,"I bought this coffee pot because my expensive Kurieg coffeemaker died! It was my 2nd one that I had purchased and I wanted to get away from using the expensive  Kurieg pods, but still enjoy a fast cup of coffee! With this one I would also have the option of a full pot if needed! At first I was a bit disappointed because I couldn't find filters that would fit on the single cup size. I was tearing larger filters in half and folding over the excess, but it was messy as grounds still escaped. Not tearing the filter in half and just twisting it closed as some suggest, to me, just slowed the brewing time down as it took forever for it to stop dripping due to the amount of paper the water had to drip through.<br /><br />So, I ordered a small box of the senseo type &#34;fill your own pod&#34; filters. I thought the sealer that you need to use to seal these pods was way too expensive! I read that a lot of folks were sealing the pods with an iron and making up a large batch of pods at a time, so I decided to give that option a try.  I found a canning ring  (someone suggested this) and it worked well as a base. I proceeded to fill 30 pods, some with regular grounds for my morning/early afternoon coffee and some with decaf for evening cups or for my friends and family who need decaf. This seemed to go well and I finished pretty quickly and was feeling optimistic! But when I started to put them in snack size ziplock bags, two per bag, to keep them fresh, grounds started escaping from the pods! I had to start resealing with the iron all the leaking pods! I was starting to get tired of fooling with all this, and thinking I did not want to have to do this every time I needed more pods! I started using the pods I had made, putting them in the little pod holder that snaps in over the permanent filter that came with the pot. I was disappointed because the pod seemed to shift to the side when the water dripped. This meant that the water was only utilizing a small part of the grounds and the coffe was weak. Not good for me because I like a strong cup! What to do?<br /><br />I thought maybe a smaller basket filter that wouldn't have so much paper to fold over would be better, so I looked for some of those at the supermarket, but couldn't find any. I looked on Amazon and they have them but I found they were expensive and I wasn't really sure that option would work to my satisfaction either.<br /><br />So back to my refillable pods! I tried putting the pods directly into the permanent filter but didn't want to remove the pod holder because I actually had a box of prefilled pods that I had bought by mistake sometime back that my husband was using up, so I left it in and just let it sit over the pod I filled myself. Bingo! Much better! The pod holder kept the homemade pod in place and the coffee was stronger! But there was still the issue of all the work I had gone through to make those pods!<br /><br />So I decided to experiment with not actually sealing them. I put an empty pod in the bottom of the permanent filter, leaving the flap opened so I could fill it with my grounds. After putting in the grounds I flipped the flap over the grounds and then let the pod holder sit on top of the unsealed pod. Brewed my cup on the bold setting and anxiously awaited the results! I am pleased to say it worked perfectly! I had a good, strong cup of coffee and no grounds in my cup! Now to check the difficulty in removing the used grounds and unsealed filter. Hummm! If you try to lift it out, you will have a mess! To avoid a mess I simply grabbed the edge of the filter, standing over the garbage can, and SLID it sideways into to garbage can. No mess! I didn't even have to rinse out the filter!  Problem solved! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I had to go through all this to find my solution! No problems at all on the carafe side!",4,2017-07-29,12.0,True,,Finally love it!,,

86,1,"I bought this to replace our coffee maker when it died. I was skeptical about the luxury feature of the single-cup brewing, but decided to go with it on a whim. Turns out it's the only part of the coffee maker I use now! I love that I can make the exact amount of coffee I want for any size mug in the house. Simply add the water that matches my mug, leaving as much room as I'd like for dairy, and that's what I get for brewed coffee. No dregs sitting around in the pot, no guessing on the grounds to get the right amount of coffee. The option to do light or dark roast makes a huge difference for the various preferences in the house, and one of the family has even started using the single-serve side to brew her mug of tea each morning. Works great for that, too!<br /><br />I have owned it for just over a month now and only used the carafe for a dinner party.

Keep in mind there is a filter already in the single serve, but if you make a pot of coffee you will need your own filters.  lastly, this does NOT take K cups - you will use ground coffee in a &#34;mini&#34; filter that comes with this to make your single serve cup.",4,2018-01-29,,True,,Best of both worlds,,

The aforementioned K-cups will last for thousands of years in our landfills.<br /><br />It takes approx. 2-3 mins for a 16oz cup to brew in the single serving side. The cleanup is a breeze and I must add...it's imperative to keep the special filter clean after each use.",5,2018-03-21,,True,,More Eco-Friendly than K-Cups,,
160,1,"Love this product! I finally received it in the mail and didn't realize it was a huge as it was, wow. It's very well built and came in very good condition. I did not receive a thermal cup with it, but it did let me know that I would not receive cup with the product, so I purchased my own. I set the product up very easily, and found that there were no instructions in the box so I just pressed and tested the product. It programs and has a bright green light that stays on after you program it to come on at a certain time. It uses regular coffee filters on the Carafe side and it has a filter on the one serving side, you can brew it regular or bold. It did come with 5 coffee filters and another piece that I have no idea what it is for oh well I guess some where down the line I will figure that out. So far I really like this product and would suggest you purchasing it. I purchased this product new. It's simple to program, has a clock you set, on off power button and programmer, pretty simple.

164,1,"Easy to use, great features with the program option, nice display, and the dual brewer. I can fit my 30oz Yeti clone on the single side, although even with 8oz of milk added to the 14oz of coffee that only fills my cup 2/3 of the way up. Exceeding the 2 scoop recommendation on single serve can, but not always result in grounds spilling into the cup, but it does help get a stronger cup brewed. It's pointless to try an exceed the 14oz water limit unless you like weak coffee. The single serve basket is as easy to clean as any other reusable basket, but I so wish extras were available for sale (-1 star). I like to let the grounds dry out in the basket before I put them in a container for sprinkling around my acid loving flowers (wet grounds get moldy fast), so I can really only do that with multiple baskets or limiting myself to one use per day. I drink a lot more coffee, so my alternative has been using the full size carafe, but I lose the fresh taste advantage after the first cup full. The chief design flaw in this is the full size carafe. It has a lip around the top edge to keep the handle attached which interferes with the pouring spout (-1 star). This lip makes it impossible to get all the water out or all the brewed coffee out which is annoying. Through comparison use with my old drip coffee maker I've also found I prefer cone coffee filters to the basket style (easier to pick up and remove paper filters for drying and easier to clean reusable filters (no ribs to get in the way of scraping off grounds with a spoon), but this otherwise does the job and I really liked the single serve feature so I kept it.",3,2018-02-15,12.0,True,,"Good, but minor improvements would make it great",,

209,1,First of all it’s really pretty. It makes a great cup of coffee too. We have only used the single serve side so far because there are three of us and we all leave st different times. Super easy and convenient and we all get a nice fresh cup in under 3 min!!! Another plus is the permanent filter for the single serve.  Rinse it and it’s ready to go. Other reviews said they had issues with the grounds spilling over on the single serve side. There are two marks inside the filter. One is minimum fill line and duh the other is max. I’m willing to guess people didn’t read the instructions (because how hard can it be to make a cup of coffee) and over filled it. We have not had a problem. Can’t wait for the weekend to use the main pot. Only down side..... I wish it made a sound when the coffee was ready. My old one beeped three times. For some reason that really made me happy.,5,2018-07-24,5.0,True,,Love the single serve option.,,

I absolutely love this coffee maker!!  It does NOT use Kcups ...it uses soft PODS...hard to find..Amazon has them..I bought them but found they were tasteless so I would add half tablespoon of ground coffee on top of the pod.

211,1,I loved the idea of kicking our Keurig to the curb and this seemed like an awesome deal! We ran water through it first to clear it out as suggested and then brewed a great pot of coffee using the carafe. On my 3rd time making a pot this morning the carafe cracked. I will not be purchasing another and Amazon had amazing customer service and is accepting my refund.

212,1,After 4 months the water line that feeds the hot water onto the coffee grounds clogged up. We emailed Hamilton Beach and were told we needed to “brew” a pot of vinegar through the coffee making cycle. We did and it worked for about a week. Now we’re constantly having to do the vinegar wash about twice/week or the coffee maker doesn’t make coffee.

I would not know how awesome the coffee make was unless a friend did not have it.  The first thing that impressed me was a nice piping hot cuppa coffee.  I can drink coffee black, that is not a problem.  However, when I have real half and half around, I loathe it when the coffee temp drops to unacceptable when a minor amount of cold liquid is added.  Not to worry here for light to moderate cream users.<br /><br />This is my second purchase with the Hamilton Beach line for a coffee maker. Unfortunately, the first one that I bought as a gift for someone I did not research enough about.  I found out making this purchase that I could have saved $30 by not selecting the (almost) same model that includes an insulated thermal coffee container.  Save yourself some money and get this one, it is much cheaper to supply your own thermal coffee container.  This coincides with another fave feature of this coffee maker.  I can brew just one serving.  If you use the single serve option, make certain that you reset it to the carafe option, if that is what will next be used.  You do not actual need a tall thermal container for the single brew option.  You can use a regular coffee mug.  However, to do so, simply flip the bottom area in that section to elevate the cup.  Some are saying that additional filters are needed with the single serve side. I have not found this to be the case at all.

217,1,"I adore this coffee maker. I have never been interested in a Keurig because I think Kpods are expensive and wasteful with all the plastic. This coffee maker switches back and forth from caraffe to single cup, and I have been able to fit all of my travel mugs underneath the single cup side because the cup holder is adjustable. It is extremely convenient as I am the only daily coffee drinker in my house, the rest are occasional drinkers. I like that it comes with a basket for the single cup side, but there is also a holder so you can use soft/mesh coffee single bags instead. I have not been able to locate any soft coffee pods at stores near me, but I have seem them online. However, I have not felt it necessary to buy them because of how convenient it is to just put a tablespoon of my own coffee in the reusable basket. No need for filters for the caraffe either, any reusable basket should fit in the caraffe. You can program the caraffe or single cup side easily, and have the option to brew regular or bold strength coffee. I actually found that this machine makes the coffee bold enough that I can use less coffee than with other machines and get a great flavor still. My only minor complaint is that is does take a little on the long side to brew, but I think that's why it makes great coffee, because the water runs slowly through it rather than fastly through the coffee grounds, allowing a stronger flavor.",5,2018-05-28,,True,,Absolute love it.,,

279,1,"I love this coffee maker. I have had Mr. Coffee coffee makers all my life and my last purchased one died while still in warranty. Mr. Coffee replaced it but with a model different than the one that I had. They said it was an upgrade but it had this annoying 3 beeps when it finished brewing and when it turned off after 3 hours. That one died in less than 6 months so I was in the market for a new coffee maker. I wanted one that had both carafe and individual brewing but I didn't necessarily want to be another person adding K-Cup trash in land fills.<br /><br />This Hamilton Beach model is absolutely perfect. It is a great design, looks good on the kitchen counter, is easy to use and makes great coffee. The single serving side uses either soft pods or you can use your own coffee grounds to brew a regular size mug or up to 14 oz travel mugs. This is well designed and you just can't go wrong at this price point. I'm a Hamilton Beach customer from now on.",5,2017-08-24,5.0,True,,Best coffee maker I have ever owned!

It burned out on one side, but we loved it so much that we replaced it with another, same model.  That one is over 5 years old and still going strong.  My husband makes a pot of regular coffee every morning and I make a cup of decaf on the left side twice a day.  We saw it advertised on Amazon last week for $44 and ordered a new one to keep for when ours passes on.  We do not need or desire a Keurig style.  With this coffeemaker, it’s simple and fast to make a single cup of coffee that tastes wonderful.  I really hope they never stop making this model!",5,2017-12-25,5.0,True,,Best coffeemaker!,,
281,1,"This is my favorite coffeemaker to date. It is compact and still has both the single serve and carafe (full pot) options. There is a switch to choose either the single or carafe side of the coffeemaker as well as a brew option button for &#34;bold&#34;. It has a clock and a programming feature for brewing coffee at a specific time. There is a see-through water container for the carafe side and a max-fill line (although black and hard to see) for the single serve side.<br /><br />Initially, using the single serve option, we found there were coffee grinds in our coffee. The permanent filter for the single serve side works well for coarsely ground coffee but is inadequate for fine (or even medium) ground coffee. I solved this problem by purchasing Melitta single serve coffee filters; these filters are made for the &#34;Javajig&#34; but work fine for this coffeemaker. The filters come in a box of 60 and cost about 3 dollars. There is really no need to buy the &#34;Senseo&#34; pods which are recommended. Actually, I have not even found the &#34;Senseo&#34;pods in stores in my area. I found them online, but they are expensive. Why go to the trouble and expense of ordering &#34;Senseo&#34; pods when the inexpensive Melitta filters work perfectly well? (Put 2 level tablespoons of coffee in the Melitta single serve coffee filter and put in enough water to come just below the max-fill line).<br /><br />On the downside, the coffee brewing is somewhat slower than my old Gevalia coffeemaker, but you can busy yourself with some other task in the kitchen or program the coffeemaker ahead of time.",4,2014-10-08,14.0,True,,Good coffeemaker,,
282,1,"With a lack of self control when it comes to coffee, I was going through k-cups and the cash to finance them way too quickly. I am the only coffee drinker in our family so I looked specifically for Single Serve Coffee Brewers on Amazon because I hate making a big pot and wasting some of it. This machine seemed to be the highest rated for the price so I ordered this one. It arrived today and I've recently used the single serve side and it was excellent! It does take just a little bit longer than &#34;brewing&#34; a k-cup but the coffee tastes better. Some reviews say that there are problems with overflow in the basket, but the instruction manual included with the unit tells you exactly how to avoid that. Since I read it, I had no issues. The 2-Way function of this is handy too when you really do need to make a big pot for guests or staying up late finishing work/school. The only thing I take a small issue with is that it came with a goldtone basket with the single serve side but not the carafe side. Small issue though, as Amazon offers a Hamilton Beach filter through their Add-On program so if you want one, just purchase it w/ this machine and you get the $5 or $6 price for the filter.<br />I hope this machine lasts for a long time because it's the answer to my dilemma as someone who is the only coffee-drinker in the family and didn't want to keep buying so many boxes of k-cups so often!",5,2017-12-03,4.0,True,,Nix the Pricey K-Cups and Buy this Thing Instead,,

284,1,"Makes a nice single cup of coffee with about half the amount of grounds necessary for the Aeropress, my other favorite way of making coffee. The large quantity pot on the right side also makes a good tasting batch, with the disadvantage of having a warming plate that shuts off relatively quickly.<br />Here's the interesting part. We've used the single cup maker far more than the carafe. It's fast, easy, and convenient. So today, when I hit the button to make a cup and nothing happened, my first thought was, &#34;Lasted a month, too good to be true.&#34; But after filling the reservoir with clean water and gently rolling the brewer around before dumping clearly contaminated (with grounds) water, several times, the machine now works as usual.<br />My fault for putting in too much ground coffee in the basket, which then caused the brew water to back up into the reservoir, carrying grounds with it. My next iteration suggestion for Hamilton Beach is a basket with a (removable or hinged) mesh top that might prevent the grounds from floating back down into the reservoir.<br />Overall I'm happy, but will update if there are more issues.<br />P.S. Remove the various parts from the brewer before you turn it upside down ( I know, you're smarter than I am, but there are no fewer than four things that can fall out). And, buy a few of the black 3M sticky hooks to store things like the pod attachment, scoops, etc, from the side of the machine.",4,2018-01-25,10.0,True,,Don't put too much coffee in the single serve basket,,
285,1,"This is really a great coffee maker. I like the versatility of being able to make one cup or a pot.<br /><br />The coffee pot side will stay warm for two hours after you brew the coffee. The only reason I took off one star was that if you make a pot, then make a single cup during that two hour time, the pot warmer will shutoff when you make the single cup.  It’s actually a good safety feature, but it means that if you are planning to brew both a single cup and a pot atvaround the same time, be sure you make the single cup first, so that the pot will stay hot for two hours.",4,2017-12-10,5.0,True,,Great coffee maker with cool features,,

I have also used the timer on it several times.

I used to work at a coffee shop, so not only do I like my coffee really strong, but I also have a palate that is capable of letting me know when something isn't right.  I ran a whole bunch of vinegar and Brew Rite through the machine but that didn't help.  I even took the whole thing apart and cleaned out the heating element and one-way valve.  That did nothing.  There are no clogs and nothing wrong that I can see, but this coffee maker still brews really weak coffee.  One thing I noticed that I never noticed before was that when emptying the grounds after brewing a pot of coffee, there are usually some dry grounds at the top.  Like I said, I've cleaned the machine thoroughly and taken it apart.  I have no explanation for the mysteriously weak coffee.",3,2016-01-05,,,,"Great for a while, now mysteriously weak",,

It's not a Bun so if your wanting that three minute full pot of coffee deal this isn't for you.  However if you don't mind waiting 6-8 minutes for a pot then this is for you.  It does have a stopper on it so while it's brewing you can pull out the pot and pour a cup.  It takes flat filters and in my opinion I like it, some feel the cone shape filters are better.  I grind my beans and personally I think that is what makes a better cup of coffee.  The single side does a great job and finishes in less than 2 minutes.

So many of the reviews (especially negative) say they expected the travel mug to come with it or were expecting it to be compatible with K-cups.  The first line of the description says specifically that it does not come with the travel mug and it is not compatible with K-cups.  Come on people not that hard to read a description and then be fair when reviewing.<br />Actual quote from the description:  &#34;Two ways to brew -- single cup or full 12-cup glass carafe or 14-oz travel mug (not included).

362,1,Terrible customer service from Hamilton beach. I was given this product as a new home gift and worked great for about 6 months. 3 months after owning it the hot plate started chipping and peeling and then rusting. A few months later it just stopped brewing. I did all the trouble shooting that I could find to no avail. After calling customer service and telling them my issues I was told I could pick out another coffee maker and have it shipped to me and that I would have to cover the shipping costs. I picked a coffee maker that was less money than the one purchased by about $30 and asked for HB to cover shipping since it was a lesser value item and was denied. I could have paid lesser shipping but then would have to wait an additional 7 days on top of the 7-10 days already quoted. Also the item will not be shipped until they recieve a photo of the disabled item. Will never purchase another item from Hamilton Beach again.,1,2017-10-16,,,,Terrible customer service from Hamilton beach,,
363,1,I use my coffee maker most of the time to make a single cup of coffee in the mornings. Usually I use a pint glass for my cup but for early mornings I use a 16 oz insulated travel mug with a tight fitting lid. (I haven't used the one the unit came with -- it's 12 oz and it has a hole in the lid so the coffee can get into the cup without splashing.) Also on those early mornings it's nice to have the coffee start just before my alarm goes off. The buttons for using the unit are simple. There's a physical switch for picking between cup and carafe. The unit uses all the water available in the reservoir just just pour in the amount you want to get out. There's no &#34;set&#34; mode for setting time -- just press the hour & minute buttons. The &#34;Program&#34; button is the one you want for scheduling coffee. There's a light built into it. If you push it once and it doesn't light up you don't have a program set. Hold it down and use the hour/minute buttons to set your program. Then push it once more and you should have a light. Push it again to cancel the program.,5,2014-05-11,,,,Convenience without the cost,,

Don't know but for me good, fast, hot coffee using my old k-cups.<br /><br />How? (Being male I did not read the instructions.)  First I set aside the carafe, [thx  reviewers!] pressed in-and-down my k-cup and slide the tray back in.

If you want something that will last long-term, however, then I definitely wouldn't buy this coffee maker. We are both avid coffee drinkers, so we used it alot, but it has broken twice in the less than two years we've had this model. Hamilton Beach replaced the first one that broke because it quit working while still under the one year warranty, we just had to pay shipping. The second time, they offered us 50% off to replace it... not sure if I'll buy a third one...

368,1,"What a great coffee maker. I dont know what Hamilton Beach has done to make their maker different as far as a superior brew, but it is better coffee than any other coffee maker ive used. Ive been using this daily for over a year and couldnt be happier. Now, i enjoy coffee...real coffee. Boiling black water from a gas station doesnt cut it for me. In fact, i used a pour-over set up for years because it was the only way i could get the most out of my grounds/beans. I havent used my pour-over for almost a year now. I cant make any better coffee with it than i can a whole pot with this maker. Its the same for the single serve side. The product info says use slightly less grounds for single serving. Ive found that about a tablespoon and a half of grounds per 8oz cup works perfect. A GREAT cup of coffee. The single serve side is so handy, too. Easy to set up, brews fast, tastes incredible, and cleans up quick.

369,1,"Makes great coffee. Love the flexibility of making just one cup with the normal ground coffee we'd use for a full pot (instead of a pod). Everything goes into the dishwasher for easy clean-up.<br /><br />Would be great if it came with a filter basket for the carafe side, but we added one separately without any issues.<br /><br />UPDATE 8/12/18: After several months of use and washes in the dishwasher, the lettering on the side of the carafe is coming off -- in a kind of comical way, where the letters now look like some in-progress word jumble. It doesn't really bother me, though measuring the number of cups we're making now requires us to guess first at the tap and then watch as we pour the water into the reservoir (where the markings are still intact). I'm guessing now that there's a note somewhere that says &#34;don't put in dishwasher&#34; or some such, but in case this is a thing -- well, there you go.<br /><br />I've also noticed that the single-serve side of the maker can't really handle more than one tablespoon of coffee grounds. (At two tablespoons, the grounds bubble up and stick to the top of the coffee maker and create a real mess.) So it's fine for an 8- or 10-oz cup of medium-strength coffee. But if you like strong coffee or want to brew enough for, say, a 16-oz thermos, this might not work for you.",5,2018-06-20,,True,,Makes great coffee. Love the flexibility of making just one ...,,
370,1,"Great coffee maker.  Yes this is the older model, the newer one has the single serve on the right side, but this model works wonderful.  I really like the single serve function.  I can get 2 uses out of the single cup grounds.  My husband gets his coffee at 5:30, I make mine at 7:30 with adding just a little bit more coffee to the filter.  Yes I go a little bit above the fill line for grounds, but I haven't had any issues with overflow of grounds.  I like that I can also use the regular carafe on the weekends when I make more than just one cup for the family.  I like the flexibility of having 2 coffee makers in one, without spending an arm and leg for a Keurig.  It does NOT support the K-cups, but this is just fine with me.  I think they are too expensive anyway and love the fact that I can use a regular can of my favorite coffee, which is less expensive.  I may buy some coffee pods to just plop into the grounds cup, but I doubt.  Again not necessary with regular ground coffee.  Also for single serve cups, you don't need those tiny filters.  I have not once had any grounds in my coffee.  Yes if you use the carafe, you will need coffee filters, but those things are like $1.50 for 100? They can last 2 years!

There's a K-Cup adapter for this part of the machine also, but I don't use that crap so who cares. :).  Another thing I've noticed is that when the water reservoir is about empty when making a pot, some coffee machines can get very noisy and grumbly - I havne't noticed that with this machine.

The k-cups are just too expensive, and we like being able to brew a whole pot for guests.

If we use cold water it DOES NOT get hot enough to extract flavor from the coffee grounds.<br /><br />Also, there was a &#34;seasoning&#34; period with this pot. Now that we've been using it for a few week, the coffee comes out good consistently, and we don't notice any odd plastic flavors. The first few pots were a little weak and synthetic tasting, but not anymore. Get the gold-tone filter for the carafe side; it's worth the difference in flavor!<br /><br />The only reason I can't give 5-stars is that it doesn't get the water quite hot enough to make a BRILLIANT cup of joe, and the coffee comes out of both sides in a slow little thread-like trickle.

I have yet to use the single cup brew, telling me that I really didn't need it. The programming is easy and fairly intuitive. The water level view is on the side towards the back and does help in filling the water resevoire correctly. I wish, however that it was placed where I could see the water level from the front as I have to pull the unit out to view it now. Brews a decent cup of coffee and a full pot does not take long to complete. I descale it on a regular basis with vinegar and I think this helps with coffee quality and longevity of machine. The one thing I am concerned with is the coffee pot. It doesn't seem to have much weight to it and appears rather delicate. I have a difficult time removing the lid to clean and am very concerned that one of these days, it's going to break. Preemptively looked at replacement pots and they are expensive.

376,1,"We have had the Hamilton Beach 49980A 2-Way Single Serve Brewer and Coffee Maker for just over a year.  It has worked fine to this point.  We use the single serve more than the full pot.  It is used almost daily, so it has been used over 300 times.  The coffee maker is basic, but brews the coffee fine.  It has a &#34;bold&#34; feature for the full pot for slightly stronger coffee.  In truth, I don't notice that big of a difference on&#34;bold&#34; versus the regular mode.  The coffee is hot and it keeps the coffee hot for a couple of hours.  We use paper filter, but there is a permanent filter available.<br /><br />The single serve unit works OK.  The coffee is weaker and only warm.  There are no options for the single serve.  It helps a little to put warm water instead of cold water in the reservoir, but even so, I usually end up putting the cup of coffee in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to boost the temperature.<br /><br />Replacement parts are expensive.  The little filter on the single serve was gumming up.  I wanted to replace it, but at a cost of between $20-$80 (depending upon shipping method)  from the Hamilton Beach site it was hard to justify the purchase for just a tiny filter.  In fact, that borders on the ridiculous.<br /><br />I like the option of single serve or full pot.  It is a good coffee maker for the price; however, because of the repair or replacement part expense, this is more of a &#34;disposable&#34; coffee maker that you would probably just toss in the trash if it needed repair or parts replacement.",3,2014-02-04,7.0,True,,Works Good.

Its simple to use and setup. Truly the only complaint is that the power chord is in such an awkward position. Its dead center of back and so you really can't push flush against the wall. On top of that, it is extremely short. I ended up using an extension chord to position where I wanted and ability to push back under upper cabinets. As reviews have stated also, the top lids will bump into cabinets so you need that ability to pull out and push back in. It really is a solid but for the money compared to other products out there. If mine dies, I'd try to buy the exact same one again.",5,2017-12-06,,True,,I don't think there is a better option for the price,,

Keurig died, so we saw no reason to get another. This brews a carafe for us in the morning, and on weekends if we want more we can make single servings. Only draw back is the lack of a reservoir. The single serve requires you to fill with each use, and the carafe uses all the water every brew, unlike keurig which you only had to fill every few days.

That is a HUGE plus for me.  I wanted a coffee maker that did NOT have a bunch of bells and whistles that are a pain to learn.<br />This coffee maker is stainless steel, which I love.<br />It has a single cup maker on the side with a stainless steel insulated take-along cup that the coffee drips into. It does keep the coffee warm once it's brewed.<br />It makes coffee without having to buy expensive pods.  It uses regular coffee on both the single serve side and for the glass pot side.  That's a feature that I wanted.<br />It has an on-off switch and a switch to slide to either single serve, or regular pot of coffee.<br />Very basic operation.....which is wonderful. 👍<br />It brews a great cup of coffee.<br />The price is reasonable.<br />5 stars all the way.<br />I am very happy I bought this coffee maker.",5,2014-02-07,,,,Buy this Hamilton Beach 49980A 2-way Single Serve Brewer and Coffee Maker,,
455,1,"I got mine in a $20 Kindle Fire sale. This coffee machine is great for usual drip coffee. It seems Hamilton Beach has trouble getting coffee hot without relying on the burner to do the work the initial water would have done. All their coffee products have this complaint and mine is not unlike the other reviews who want properly extracted and hot coffee. The machine does have upsides. It brews in a hurry and if someone didn't clean the grounds out of one half you have the single serve. Single serve is amazing if you need coffee NOW and you're in a hurry. The multiple cup brew side makes better tasting coffee. The single serve side has a thing that is supposed to make kcups happen. Like Fetch, kcups just aren't gunna happen kid, but it's still a nice feature. This is a good bargain for what it is a dual programmable coffee maker. But convenience will cost you taste. It's all in the needs you have in a maker. I think this is fine for  general users. Just beware that to get your coffee piping hot you'll have to use the main carafe and let it sit a few minutes after brew. All in all its a good machine for a drip machine. It's still budget coffee though. As a mom of three I need convenience over perfect taste alot of the time and I love mine. Flaws and all!",4,2014-09-02,,,True,This coffee machine is great for usual drip coffee,,
456,1,"Because of its convenience, having the ability to brew a carafe or a Kurig-style single brew serving of coffee, I purchased one of these devices.  It lasted almost 3 days before failing completely!  It would not cycle water through its heating system.  I did not buy through Amazon, which I usually do, but instead bought it from a local Bed Bath & Beyond store.<br /><br />At that time BB&B had a very flexible return policy so I took it back and they gave me a replacement unit of the same type and brand.  That was some 6 months ago.<br /><br />Yesterday, the second (replacement) unit failed.  It began to serve only half a cup, or for carafe brewing, only a portion of the water I had added to its  reservoir and leaking the remaining water onto my kitchen counter.  I'm just going to junk the damned thing and count it as a learning experience.  The lesson?  I'll NEVER buy anything made by Hamilton Beach again!<br /><br />My advice:  If you're considering this sorry piece of junk, do yourself a real favor and forget it entirely.  Buy something else!  I'll probably end up buying two different kinds of coffee makers rather than trying to save space with a combination machine.",1,2016-09-13,,,,Junk is too much praise for this sorry thing.,,
457,1,Terribly burned plastic taste and smell from the pot side. Single side doesn’t seem to have the burned plastic problem. Did the alcohol/water mix cleaning trick as recommended but the smell and taste persist. The plastic taste is so bad that it will give you a stomach ache if you try to drink the coffee.<br /><br />Single cup side will drip and drip and drip.

I can order them online but not quite as convenient . Everybody has k-cups though . I understand the newer model of this machine does use k-cups . Its not a big deal using our own favorite ground coffee , just make sure to clean the basket after use . The program light that comes on when you set it up for automatic brew is very bright .

I also bought her the 'permanent' filter that is sold separate, so she doesn't have to use paper filters.<br /><br />One big thing people should know before they buy.

With a flip of a switch you can brew 12 cups of coffee or whatever else you want to brew.  It has a clock function, auto brew timer, and brew strength features.

529,1,This is a very nice coffee pot.  This is my second of the same model.  I have one for home and one for our vacation home.<br />I bought the first one from a national retailer and looked on Amazon to see if the price was better.  It was slightly better pricing.<br />The pot I bought from the store came with the advertised to-go cup. As displayed in the picture.  The pot I bought from Amazon was in a perfectly sealed package.  No proof that it was tampered with yet there wasn't a to-go cup in the box.  I do not hold Amazon accountable.  It probably came from the manufacturer that way.  Anyway...

578,1,"Overall not terrible...EXCEPT for the filter!  I've figured out why it doesn't come with one and that's because none of the gold permanent filters really fit this machine.<br /><br />It seems they are all about an inch too short to keep a small amount of grounds from overflowing the basket and ending up in the carafe.  You want to know the most frustrating point?  I called Hamilton Beach and had them give me the correct filter part number and still no joy. This unit will be going curbside soon enough to be replaced with another dual brew machine.  Hello Cuisinart, are you listening?",2,2018-06-02,,True,,Be warned!,,

We decided to replace it because we liked the idea of having a full carafe, but also the ability to make one cup of coffee.  The Hamilton Beach model seemed to be the perfect choice.  Unfortunately, based on my experience and other reviews, the carafe is fragile and thin.  I compared it to the weight of the Mr. Coffee carafe.  The Mr. Coffee carafe is heavier and thicker.  We'll just use this Hamilton Beach model until the carafe cracks again.  Then, we'll go back to Mr. Coffee.",1,2018-06-24,,True,,Fragile Carafe,,

Sometimes the coffee is right, sometimes it’s more water than coffeee. The machine has been inconsistent on both sides from day one. It’s never brewed the same pot or cup of coffee. Wish I could return it but it’s past the window. Waste of money. You get what you pay for. My previous coffee maker was a cuisinart that lasted over 10 years.",1,2018-06-24,,True,,Junk,,
581,1,"My wife is the only coffee drinker in our family, so the great reviews and the separate, single server side tipped our decision in favor of the Hamilton Beach instead of the Cuisinart. We had a Mr. Coffee, but it was not brewing strong enough for her and was not getting all the grounds wet. So she was having to use more and more coffee grounds to make it taste right. It was time for another coffee maker.<br /><br />With this coffee maker she is using less coffee grounds and getting a better taste. The single brew side is perfect for her everyday coffee needs, and it even makes the coffee strong enough (strong brew setting) for her iced coffee. For a Hamilton Beach brand it was a little costly, but it has put a happy, coffee smile on my wife's face, and that was worth the few extra dollars!",5,2014-01-01,,True,,My wife loves it...,,

The color of the coffee is what you would get if you mixed half a cup of coffee and added a cup of water.  I just made coffee with the same amount of beans, it came out weak then I made another pot with the same amount of beans and less water, even worse!

The cup that comes with it solves this but then you have to wash it every day.

I bought the 2-in-1 thinking I could save space and have a carafe brewer handy when serving guests.

This coffee maker is easy to use and is so helpful for people with busy mornings.<br /><br />The fact that they fold over the ends of the tape on the maker when packaging your product so you can easily unpack it and use it right away with no hassle says alot about the quality.

Just dump out the old grounds, swish it under the faucet, pour in the fresh grounds, and brew. Fast and easy. Occasionally, I make a whole pot and that works fine as well.

704,1,"My one-star rating is based on the fact that the product I received is totally unusable. I've searched for the right coffee maker for months, since my Keurig has begun to fail. I was super excited about getting to use this machine. However, upon opening the package, I knew I had a bad product. This machine smells so bad that no amount of cleaning has weakened the odor. Last night, I thoroughly cleaned it, set it out to dry, and then brewed a pot this morning. It's been four hours since I had a cup of coffee from this brewer, and I still can't get rid of the awful aftertaste in my mouth. I'm so disappointed and mildly grossed out. I can only assume that, at this price point, this machine is made with low-quality parts and materials. It's too bad this didn't work out, as I was really impressed with the features on this coffee maker. My question to Hamilton Beach is this: Why, and how, are you sending out food-prep products that have such a strong, terrible odor? I know I'm not the only one to have had this problem. If I could smell it before opening the box, then it should've been caught before leaving your facilities. Unacceptable.

He drinks his coffee on the way to work and he didn't want to take the risk of the top slipping off so he uses his own thermos. Also, you can't use the pods with it unless you open them up and pour them into the filter. That isn't an issue for us though because we don't use pods. He loves that it's a mesh reusable filter on the single serve side. We have used the pot side only a handful of times and it brews coffee very fast. That side does use paper filters.

I don't like how companies are switching to the reusable filter (there's always coffee powder floating in the cup), and am happy that this one uses the old fashioned filters.

As others have said, it does feel flimsy. My $30 coffeemaker I had for years before this felt much more substantial than this. Secondly, I suggest cleaning both the carafe side and individual serving side with vinegar as suggested and then running several cycles with coffee. It took a good week or two for the coffee to taste ok. It was definitely bitter and plastic-tasting even after the vinegar cleaning. But the bad taste did go away after a week or two of using daily. Now it makes a decent (not amazing) cup. I probably wouldn't buy this again, but I do like having the carafe side for when we have guests and the single serving side for my daily use.",3,2014-06-22,2.0,True,,"Like, but don't love it",,

I am using some inexpensive paper inserts for the coffee wire basket to make cleaning a little easier to clean. For me, I only need about two table spoons of coffee per single cup. I use the mug that is going to hold my coffee to measure the water and pour it in. I had a bit of trouble figuring out the instructions for the piece that holds a mug or cup up close to the where the freshly made coffee comes out. There is kind of a cylinder that goes on the base of the coffee maker and your mug or cup goes on top of that. Possibly I need to learn more about keeping my cupacoffee warm a few minutes as it seems to cool down quickly. Otherwise, its great and, when I need more than a cup, I've no doubt the large pot will work just fine.

However, the single serve side makes weak coffee despite the &#34;Bold&#34; setting, a bit more coffee makes it a bit better. (definitely more grounds than should be necessary for a single mug).

795,1,"4/1/17--I assure you, this is no April Fool's. My beloved coffee pot only lasted 5 months. Heed the warnings from reviewers that say it leaks. Mine began leaking as well, in exactly the same spot on the single serve side (near the brew basket area) as other reviewers have mentioned. I have used this coffee pot a lot, but I maintain it well and expected that it would at least last a year! The poor thing didn't even survive half that. The only way I can use it now is if I place towels all around the base. It was fantastic while it lasted, but it appears that my situation is not unique and that this particular coffee pot is quite likely to leak, either from the get-go, or after only a few months use. I can no longer recommend it.<br /><br />ETA: I use the single serve side so much that I went in search of an extra brew basket, because I didn't want to be without one in case my original should get worn out. The original still works fine, but I would be in a bind if anything happened to it because I use it so many times each day, so I wanted a spare. The only replacement brew basket for this model that I could find was direct from the manufacturer and it was expensive. I found that the 49983 brew basket can be modified to fit this model and it can be purchased affordably at online auction. Though I didn't purchase the 49983 brew basket on Amazon, I did review it, so if you want to see photos of how to adapt that brew basket for this model, please check out that review.<br /><br />I purchased this coffee pot to replace a BUNN. My last two coffee pots were BUNNs, and each of them lasted several years before succumbing to the effects of our very hard water. I like the BUNN, but decided to try this Hamilton Beach coffee pot this time because it offers the ability to brew a single cup. I also like that this one has the ability to program it to have coffee ready when you wake up, which is a feature common to many coffee pots, but one that the BUNN coffee pots do not have. I was ready for a change, and this pot is half the price of the BUNN, so I went for it and I'm so glad I did. The Hamilton Beach coffee pot brews up a great pot of coffee, and I use the single-serve side multiple times throughout the day for both tea and coffee. I have found that I prefer my loose leaf tea brewed in the single serve basket with the &#34;BOLD&#34; option selected. Most teas (I like DAVIDsTEA products) brew up very well this way, and I like how brewing tea this way leaves a cleaner cup of tea with less loose bits and sediment that I tend to get when I use a tea ball infuser. I'm sure I'm breaking all kinds of tea-brewing rules by doing it this way, but it's what I like and it works well for me. When I brew tea from a teabag, I will often just place the tea bag in the cup and then fill the cup with hot water using the single serve side and then let it steep. The only time I don't brew from a tea bag this way is if I'm brewing a medicinal tea, for which I would want hotter water for a stronger infusion. These are just my preferences and are examples of how I use this coffee pot, but I honestly love this coffee pot and if hard water (we clean it, but still...) eventually takes the life of this pot, I wouldn't hesitate to replace it with another just like it. I don't miss my BUNN at all.",1,2017-01-11,7.0,True,,Heed the warnings of leaks! Leaking after 5 months of use,,
796,1,"Our ""cup"" coffee maker died a premature death and not wanting to spend the big bucks again we bought this serviceable coffee maker.

After the death of the other coffee machine we were forced make instant coffee like barbarians. It was a dark time. The crystals were barely enough to keep things going. I dragged my feet, not able to choose which coffee maker should replace the old one. Maybe insufficient caffeine slowed my progress.

804,1,"Love it.  It makes a great pot of coffee, but it's the single serve brewer that sold me.  I like a really strong cup of coffee, and I found that unless I cut the water with a K cup or a pod--hence giving me a smaller cup of coffee than I really wanted--the coffee was too weak.  I also prefer coffee with chicory, which can be expensive and/or hard to find in k cups, so not only would I not get the amount of coffee I wanted, but I often couldn't find the kind of coffee I wanted.

Much more economical and flexible.<br /><br />Pros: It heats the water quickly (brews faster than the Krups or GE we've compared it to). Has some nice features like: shutting off drip on the carafe if you pull out the carafe, and shunting extra water from the single brew side to the carafe side if you over fill (it seems to stop at about 16oz).  It fits large mugs and travel cups (up to 30oz) on the single brew side. You can drop the tea bag into the single brew filter or in your mug (for stronger tea). It uses a fairly small amount of ground coffee, compared with our old coffee maker (Krups thermal carafe style).<br /><br />Cons: no alarm to have your coffee ready and waiting in the AM (though the quick brew time makes up for it). If you make coffee on the single brew side, expect your tea to have a coffee flavor to it. To get around this, I am using the carafe to make hot water and pouring it into a mug from there, instead of using the single brew side. I am also ordering a second part to replace the one that is coffee flavored, and we will use both (one for tea, one for coffee). If you love coffee flavored tea, then this will not be a problem for you.<br /><br />Overall super happy with it, as is husband.

819,1,"We have had this in use for almost three months.This morning as I was enjoying my cup of coffee , I thought that I should share what a wonderful coffee maker this is, and how it has enhanced our lives. We had a very high end single serve machine before this. However because we were going through many k-cups as well as our coffee expense, when we saw this decided to give it a try. We are so thankful that we did! My husband is a very early riser and enjoys 2 to 3 cups of coffee in the mornings with one to go. He likes his coffee much stronger than I do, however when he brings me a cup to my bedside as I am waking it seems perfect.:) I enjoy the single serve side immensely, as I can have my flavored coffee in my nice large cup, in what seems like the same amount of time as my previous k-cup did, at least without any noticeable difference. We can set the coffee maker to start brewing the pot in the morning as he is rising. This machine is so convenient and efficient. The single serve side has a &#34; permanent filter&#34;, so that no paper, or pods, or k-cups are required. We have enjoyed this feature so much, that we also purchased the &#34;permanent filter&#34; for the full pot side. Some evenings I brew a cup a tea or decaf on the single serve side. This does not disrupt the preset for the pot side setting in the morning as you can just flip the switch over. This coffee maker takes up less space than our previous one and is nice looking addition to our kitchen. The options work very when we have company as well. We would highly recommend this Hamilton Beach Coffee Maker, in fact we do often. Enjoy!",5,2017-03-30,,True,,Lovin' our Coffee Options!,,
820,1,I ditched my Keurig because it was a PITA and I could never find the &#34;just right&#34; strong coffee.  So I switched back to a &#34;regular&#34; coffee pot.  I love the ability to make a single cup of coffee.  My only complaint is the noise it makes every so often when the heating element kicks on.  It's loud enough to be noticeable.  But got over it as it's really not that big of a deal.,5,2018-04-18,,True,,Perfect for a single cup of coffee - or a whole pot!,,
821,1,"I was skeptical about buying this because of the few bad reviews but the thing to remember is that there are way more positive reviews. I use the serve side only so far and the coffee tastes amazing. It comes out slowly but that doesn't bother me and maybe it's part of why the coffee tastes so good. I went from using a $20 Mr Coffee or something, to this and im happy. I use Starbucks, finely ground, blonde roast coffee. I follow the instructions and viola. Tasty hot coffe, no leaks, no plastic smell, low maintenance. Zero complaints, will try to check in, in a few months as well.",5,2016-03-01,3.0,True,,... was skeptical about buying this because of the few bad reviews but the thing to remember is that there ...,,
822,1,"I purchased this coffeemaker in February, 2014 but I prefer to wait several months before writing a review.  In 6 months of usage it has performed flawlessly.  The individual serving cup holds around 15 ozs and the glass carafe about 60 (six 10 oz mugs worth).  No matter which side is used, the brewing result is consistently excellent.  I have wanted a single cup coffee maker for some time (I often arise several hours before my wife, and she likes her coffee just brewed), but it seems that highly rated models are too pricey for my preferences.  This ""two-in-one"" approach is perfect for our needs.  Our old coffee maker was taking an increasingly long time to brew and when we saw this one, it seemed the perfect solution.  Everything about it was as described.  No need to buy expensive individual size coffee packets and the individual serving micro-filter brew basket makes filters on that side unnecessary.  The carafe and individual serving options each have their own brew basket and water reservoir.  The choice of which to use is controlled by a selector switch on the front panel.  I consider this to be a great product at a fair price.",5,2014-08-04,2.0,True,,Glad I found this one.,,

A new machine will be here on Monday and we'll send the leaky one back to Amazon at their expense instead of cutting the cord and throwing the appliance away as H B wanted us to do.

Love the one cup option. You have to play around with how much coffee to put in the basket for the one cup, but finally got the perfect amount. My husband works from home and drinks most of the coffee, but tries to leave enough for me. If I don't have enough I can just make another cup. No regrets with this coffee maker..... We highly recommend it!!",5,2018-04-26,,True,,Great coffee maker!!!,,
825,1,"I had been using a single serve Keurig for 6 years and was happy with the quality; however, I realized I was paying a ridiculously high price for a good cup of coffee.  I had given away my full-pot coffee maker several years ago, but I needed on occasionally for holidays and parties.  I wanted an appliance that wouldn't take up too much space, since I wanted to leave it on the countertop--and I was delighted when I saw this model.  After reading the many positive reviews, i ordered with confidence.<br />I love it!  And I will admit that I feel a little smug when I realize how much money I am saving!  I have probably saved close to the cost of the maker since I received it a couple of months ago.  i like being able to make myself a regular cup of coffee or even a mega-mug on the single-serve side.  The pot worked well for Thanksgiving dinner.  (Beware that the &#34;cups&#34; are six ounce cups, so you might need to brew a couple of pots for a large family dinner.)<br />My ONLY negative remark would be that I encountered very fine residue in the bottom of single brewed cups of coffee.  I have solved that by tearing regular filters into approximately 1/6 pieces and using them in the permanent filter  I plan to hunt for paper filters made for smaller coffee makers to see if I can find some that fit. (Note that I still rate this as a 5-star product.)<br />Even though the illustrations only show one configuration for lifting a small cup, I have learned that using one of the supports allows me to perk a large, not-so-tall cup without spattering.<br />I also use the single serve side to prepare hot water for brewing hot tea.  In reviewing other comments, I just read that I can brew loose leaves in the permanent filter.  I can't wait to try that!",5,2017-01-15,29.0,True,,Almost Perfect Coffeemaker--and It Has Already Paid for Itself!,,

You can't make both sides at the same time but that isn't a problem for me. Makes great coffee, fabulous taste, nice and hot. I have had no problem with this unit at all!  Love the clear buttons; There is a slide switch to change it from making coffee on the pot versus making a travel mug of coffee. It doesn't come with the travel mug so have a tall one handy for the machine. It's a no-brainer to use. Will buy it again if this one ever breaks.",5,2018-05-24,,True,,Great Coffee Maker!,,
827,1,"I waited a long time to get a new coffee maker and was very excited to pick out a new one over the holidays. This machine definitely lives up to the reviews--it's sturdy and easy to use. I alternate between using the carafe and the single-brew side, depending on whether I'm staying home (and how much caffeine I need!). I use the reusable mesh filter it came with on the single serve side, and it works perfectly. I love not having to use a whole filter for one cup (or use pods, which are expensive and create a lot of waste). I use paper filters on the carafe side, though I'm thinking of getting a reusable mesh filter for that side, as well.<br /><br />At first I had a little trouble, as my extra fine grounds were ending up in the coffee. However, other reviewers suggested using coarser grounds, which fixed the problem. (Pre-ground coffee will work just fine with this--I grind mine at home and was grinding them too fine.)<br /><br />The coffee brews very hot and I like the automatic shut-off feature on the warming plate after two hours. I've never left my coffee plate on, but it's a nice safety just in case!<br /><br />The unit is a little large, but you'd expect this with, essentially, two coffee makers in one.<br /><br />The travel mug that comes with it is good--doesn't leak.<br /><br />Highly recommend!",4,2014-01-20,2.0,True,,Love the features!,,

Well, this one only lasted 1.5 years. I regularly run vinegar/water solution through it to help clean it out. As of now, it takes about 1 hour to brew a pot, and it looses several cups of water during the brewing process, leaving you with super strong concentrated coffee (yuck). We tried taking it apart to clean out the interior tubing etc but those devious 3-point screws forced us to just break off the bottom. We cleaned everything out, put it back together, and plugged it in. Same problem, except now it smokes while percolating (my fiance says it's just steam but it's really thick and concerning). Forget it. We'd love to find a coffee pot that last, and this one doesn't.

The Hamilton Beach 80675 Permanent Gold Tone Filter fits just right, order it separately. Can use a flat bottom paper filter too. I like the gold tone filter HB provides for the single serve side as it does the job about as well as a paper filter...If you have to use a paper filter too on the single serve side the &#34;Simple Cups&#34; disposable K-Cup filters flatten out to fit just right into the single serve filter. Just search Simple Cups coffee filters. Resorted to this brewer after about 3 years on a K machine and am glad of the trade.

841,1,"I bought this coffeemaker over a year ago and I loved it.  I do use both sides. Most mornings the carafe and when I feel like a cup later in the afternoon, the single serve worked out great. Senseo has some great pod flavors to choose from. Recently the machine has gone down hill. It takes forever to brew coffee and it doesn't manage to brew two cups of water. So, I plan on making 8, but only 6 come out so I'm forced to add more water and wait even longer for my coffee. On top of it, the noise of water evaporating is so loud. I don't want to program it earlier than I have to because the noise alone will wake me up.  I clean it regularly and this still happened, nothing could have stopped it I feel. Of course I just purchased a bunch of Senseo pods. I got rid of a coffeemaker that I had for years and worked just fine to upgrade to this one. What a mistake.

I paid more for this one (49980A for $56) but feel it was worth it to have the option of brewing single serve coffee on the side. The single serve brewing option is not as fast as a Keurig but it is nice to be able to use regular coffee in a basket and not have to pay for pods or k cups. At full price, $80 something dollars, it is definitely NOT worth it. The quality of coffee is really no different from a $20 Mr Coffee, just a couple extra bells and whistles and it looks much nicer.

It makes a good cup of coffee, and we like the ease of use, simple to read and understand faceplate, and the handy one-cup brew option.

870,1,"I had a certain machine (rhymes with Feesonart) that died and it broke my heart. I was looking for something that could make a pot of coffee and heat water quickly. This works, but it's still unremarkable. It makes coffee (pot) just fine. Timer goes off @ 2hrs (not awesome for working from home), it doesn't beep when done, but works fast. Doesn't stay super hot, but hot enough.<br />Single coffee maker - works fast, but is limited to 14oz - and it's all or nothing - the water you put in is what you get out. Disappointed in the lack of ability to hold more water. As far as coffee, if you use the &#34;recommended&#34; amount of loose grounds in the side, you will get the weakest coffee on earth. I have had a little luck with using sheets of filter on the bottom and top with a little luck.

954,1,"Great coffee maker! Does what it's intended to do. Pros are the obvious, able to make single size or a caref (sp). Single brew side can handle my tallest travel mugs once I removed the drip tray (batman mug from Tervis). Maker is a little noisy but not more than any other machine I've purchased. Coffee is plenty hot, caref side keeps it hot for a good amount of time. I love the fact I can use my own coffee, every day I just rinse out the single serve basket and reuse. Caref side uses standard circular coffee filters. With the single side I've found it works better to not to a fine grind on the bean, I end up with sediment in the bottom of my mug. The folks at Starbucks that ground the coffee bags I purchase from them do it perfect. Two gripes: 1) There's no option to have an alert to when the coffee is done, the blue light on the front just turns off (for single, remains on for caref side until 2 hrs and it turns off burner and light at that point.). 2) On the single serve side, if I use a regular size mug the coffee splatters a little bit outwards about three inches, it might be due to the BOLD setting which might make it drip slower instead of stream, but not a big issue for me.

But I thought I'd write an updated review.<br />What's good: Coffee still tastes pretty good.<br />What's bad: --I timed the 12 cup brew today - 23 minutes. That's just way too long, in our opinion. Of course, we've had Bunns in the past, which are super fast because they keep the water hot and waiting.10 minutes is about right; 23, not good.<br />--It drips - EVERYWHERE. Now, my husband isn't as neat as he should be - but this coffee pot drips horribly when you poor a cup- on the counter, down the cupboards, the floors a mess - it's just really bad. - even when I use it and try to be extra careful.<br />--It steams - a lot. We had it under the cupboards, but I noticed moisture condensing there - we have to pull it out to use it because of the excess steam.<br />You cannot pull it out and get a cup to drink before it's done brewing. Just in case you think you can.<br />So we bought a new coffee pot from Amazon and should have it here tomorrow - we got one rated for speed, non-dripping carafe, and the ability to poor a cup before done brewing!",2,2014-01-02,2.0,,,Great for first 18 months,,
979,1,"I bought this for my Mom over a year ago. I was looking for a coffee maker that doubled as a single serve. This was the answer. I saw that the single serve feature uses Senseo pods as well as regular grounds if you run out. It's great!! A lot less expensive, too. The one thing I didn't see mentioned in other reviews that I like is the design. Mom needs to use her right hand to pick up her coffee pot (carafe) because of the weight when it is full. This model has the pot on the right with the handle facing right and the single serve on the left. Very important when strength and flexibility are issues. I love this coffee maker!! Thank you Hamilton Beach.",5,2017-01-18,,,,It's perfect for my Mom!!,,
980,1,Great coffee maker!!! So glad I got this. The coffee brews really quickly &amp; comes out hot! The single cup maker is super convenient &amp; it only takes a few scoops of coffee so it's so much cheaper than having a kuerig.

981,1,"I had huge hopes for this coffee maker! I love the carafe and single serve feature, no K-Cups! For design and features this is a 5 star coffee maker, however, the coffee just doesn't taste very good.

982,1,"Tried a couple different single cup coffee makers, and this one works best.  Filter basket on single cup side is big enough to hold enough grounds for a big strong mug of coffee.  The bold setting brews a better tasting cup of coffee than our prior maker did on &#34;strong&#34; even when now using less grounds.  Took one star off for carafe which has a band around the top that looks hard to keep clean.  Note that this machine is different from one that looks similar but has the single serve on the right side and takes K cups...that one got dinged by a consumer magazine for safety because the carafe hot plate turns on even when brewing a single serving.  This machine does not have that issue.  Perfect for those who use their own grounds and want that one cup easy in the AM and the option to serve a bunch of guests too.",4,2016-01-24,,,,Great for strong coffee drinkers,,
983,1,"I gave this as a gift.  I guess I didn't read the description well enough.  When a coffee maker states that it is also single serve I assumed (and you know what they say when you ass-u-me!!!!) that it meant K-cups or some brand comparable to K-cups. My college-aged son was really disappointed that it was K-cup friendly. Especially since I had stocked him up with K-cups. Again, this is my fault since I didn't read the description, not the coffeemaker.  Otherwise, he is very happy with it, especially the timer function. He not only sets an alarm to wake up but has his fresh coffee brew smell to help wake him up in his dorm room.  The cord is short so for a dorm room this was an issue and we needed an extension cord.  For a counter, ​the short cord would be great.",3,2018-01-28,,,,Not K-cup friendly,,
984,1,"I have the previous model which I bought in 2012 and I use it every day!  Single serve during the week and the full pots on the weekends.  It's not super fast on the brewing, but I set the timer before I go to bed and it's brewed by the time I get out of bed to take the dogs for their walk.  Don't fall for the Kuerig trap...theirs has a reservoir which never fully empties...therefore, green slime is a problem.  I'm considering purchasing this one to have on hand just in case my 6 year old machine bites the dust.",5,2017-07-09,,,,Love this machine!,,
985,1,"I bought this coffee maker my junior year of college. I'm now 27 and still use it on a daily basis. Incredibly easy to use and makes great coffee. I'm the only one in my house who makes coffee so 99% of the time I'm using the single serve option. You have to rinse it out by hand before you make another cup but that only takes a few seconds.<br /><br />The auto-brew function works well too and is intuitive to set up, although I don't usually use it.<br /><br />Wrote this review because I was admiring my coffee maker today and wondered if they still made it. Glad they do. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",5,2017-09-23,,,,Old Faithful,,

987,1,There is nothing to like about this product. The water doesn't come out and at the end of each cycle you have to turn it upside down to drain it.

The single cup serving unit takes a few tries to get used to. If you fill it up too much, you'll get coffee grounds in your cup. Other than that, once you've master the single serve, you'll be enjoying fresher, better tasting, and cheaper coffee every single morning.

I love the single serve without having to buy pods and love that it comes with a stainless coffee filter (reusable for the win!). However, I only gave it 4 stars because the large pot side of the coffee maker did not come with a stainless filter as well. Fortunately the one from our old pot fit the new machine though. We’ve been using it daily, multiple times a day for about 6 months and no issues.",4,2018-09-04,,True,,No more stale coffee and no single use pods!,,
1010,1,"I've had this coffee maker about a month now, and I'm really happy with it.  LOVE the spout guard on the pot that keeps it from dripping all over the counter when you pour into a cup or the reservoir.  Someone mentioned awhile back about the warmer plate peeling, but I think using  the pause & pour feature is probably what causes that.  If you use that feature, just make sure you wipe it off before putting the pot back on it.  I really like the single side too, but we use it only for an occasional single cup or to make tea.  And you don't have to buy single serve pods--I really like that.  A 7-inch coffee thermos fits perfectly under it, and the little stacking lifter pieces for raising smaller cups is really nice too.  I also got the gold tone filter, and that works great with it too.  Yes, it leaves some residue in the bottom of the pot for the last cup, but it's nice not to have to buy filters any more.  Also, very reasonable priced.",5,2018-02-24,2.0,True,,and I'm really happy with it,,

The coffee is brewed hotter than the units that we had for years. When you remove the carafe, coffee does not drip onto the heating element. It always did with the Mr. Coffee causing the protective coating to eventually peel. I really like the option of making one cup at a time but haven't tried that yet.

1013,1,"I bought this to replace an Oster Coffeemaker and a Kuerig K45 Elite. The Oster leaked and the pot spilled coffee all over when attempting to pour and irritated the man in my life no end. (I don't drink coffee). I liked the Keurig. I'm a tea drinker and liked the convenience of making a cup of tea at a time and I didn't have to try to keep a pot warm. My Kuerig was noisy and irritated the man in my life no end. (Do you see a pattern here?) This Hamilton Beach Coffeemaker is amazing. It's compact, easy to use and quiet! It doesn't leak and the pot pours without spilling. I love the single serve option. The water reservoir for the two sides are separate. This makes it possible for me to brew only enough tea to fill my cup. I love this feature. Replacing two appliances on my counter frees up space for other things. Overall this purchase improves my life and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a great product.",5,2017-02-21,,True,,Amazing and life improving.,,
1014,1,"I have had this coffee maker for a few months. So far, I love it, because it makes great coffee and the versatility to be able to make a single serve. We use a regular brewer in the morning and the single serve for only one family member who likes an afternoon cup of coffee.  I had been looking for an alternative to K-Cups and I really like the single-serve Senseo pods, as there is no plastic waste and you are not brewing your coffee in a plastic cup with a glued in filter. The pods are a little harder to find, but I ordered them on Amazon.  It also looks really sharp with stainless finishes and nice display.  It's also easy to use.  I was more than happy to let this machine take the place of two on my countertop.  So far, the only drawback that I have seen is that if you get a flimsy paper filter, it sometimes will fold in while you're brewing the coffee and grounds get in the coffee.  I started to be more careful about not handling the filters and making sure the rigid side was on the side that folded over and so far have not had that problem again.  The price is great for such a high quality and versatile product.  I am very happy with my purchase.",5,2016-06-04,2.0,True,,Love the Machine and the Pods,,
1015,1,"Great coffee maker - very nice! I love the individual serving side which allows you to make just one serving - put the coffee grounds directly into the little reusable basket. You can make a pot or one serving - or both - if you have one person who wants a different type of coffee than what you make in the pot. This is a very nice-looking unit too for the price and practicality. Works very well, I've programmed it for instant brewing in the morning and it's easy to pour the water into each reservoir. The digital clock is nice, easy to read the water level desired as you are pouring water in the reservoir. Wish I had gotten this a long time ago, we've struggled with coffee makers - some very pricey, &#34;better brands&#34; are not necessarily the best. My husband did not like the Bonivita I purchased a few years ago - he likes this much better because the coffee stays hot with the burner.

Worked great, & we loved being able to make a full pot in the morning for the family, and individual cups in the afternoon. Then one morning in October (not even 2 months after purchasing), it just stopped working; would not make a full pot, and coffee was not hot. I assumed machine needed to be cleaned, did so, & still it refused to work. I returned to Bed, Bath & Beyond & they happily let me exchange it. I decided to give the same machine another try, thinking the original was just a lemon. Again, 2 months later, coffee machines will not work. I am heading back to Bed, Bath & Beyond for a refund or exchange & will not be purchasing a Hamilton Beach again.

I even seriously considered the Ninja Coffee Bar system, but who was I kidding? I'm never going to take the time to make all those different types of coffee and when it comes down to it, I'm a purist. I just like coffee itself and don't need anything really fancy to make it (let's not mention the money I saved too). What I love the most is that you can program both sides. I just drink a cup in the morning, so its awesome waking up to a cup already made. I docked one star because for every cup you make on the single side, you have to refill the reservoir. I wish there was an easier way to only have to fill it once (like several cups full). Maybe I'm too use to my Keurig in this aspect, but whatever, I'd like to not have to always refill it.

The timer functions are reasonably simple to use once you've played with them a little bit. The carafe is well designed - - doesn't drip when pouring. For decades, I used only a coffee cone and boiling water to make the perfect cup. Eventually, I wanted the convenience of a timer.

1299,1,"I love this coffee pot. We decided to upgrade from ours, which was several years old, and chose this one because it offers both the carafe and single serve options. It's simple to use and brews a good pot of coffee. My only complaint is that sometimes we end up with grounds at the bottom of the pot. The tiny basket on the individual side almost always overflows with grounds when the water is added and ends up in your cups. It's not the end of the world, but could easily be fixed with a permeable lid for the basket. I'm sure we probably overfill a bit, but we've reduced the amount of grounds we use and still have a problem. We like strong coffee, so we don't want to reduce the grounds too much. Overall, though, we love this coffee maker",4,2016-07-31,6.0,True,,"Great pot, some grounds problems",,

There is however a small reusable filter for your own coffee with the single serve option. The main coffee maker can also fit a reusable filter which is a nice feature.<br />The included travel mug appears to be 12-14oz in size. The space to set the cup in the single serve spot is too short to fit most 16oz Starbucks travel mugs. You can remove a piece to make more space however the mug doesn't sit flat and wobbles as bit. Finally, the carafe felt like very thin glass and proved it when it broke on its second use.

1368,1,"After our previous coffeemaker stopped working, we needed a replacement to brew the usual carafe of ground coffee a few times a day. This model was very intriguing, since it also seemed to provide a way to brew a single cup if one person gets up earlier or a guest wants a cup after dinner. I was skeptical at first, since multi-function machines don't always do what they claim. However, this coffeemaker is superb, and is the only one I've seen that lets you use regular coffee grounds for either the carafe or the single-serve side.<br /><br />One useful tip: although there's a gold filter included for the single-serve side, we prefer to use paper filters for easier cleanup. However, we couldn't find any paper filters at a reasonable price that would fit the somewhat unusual basket size. So, we just take regular 8-12 cup filters, cut them down, and they seem to work great.",5,2014-02-23,,True,,An excellent way to brew a whole pot or a single cup using regular coffee grounds,,

Our k-cup type coffeemaker had reached the end of its life, and I had been missing the smell of the morning pot of coffee brewing, but also like only using the coffee I need. So this Hamilton Beach coffeemaker allows us to do both, and without the wasteful little plastics cups. The single serve side has a reusable filter. Every cup +/or pot of coffee has tasted delicious!  No plastic taste at all. The price was very reasonable.  I reviewed many coffeemakers before purchasing this one. This was the least expensive, and well worth the money. No plastic taste, no issues. We've had this coffeemaker since 2015 and it's still going strong. I think I may purchase another one to have as a back up!",5,2015-06-03,,True,,Buy it!,,
1370,1,"I ordered this maker on the basis of other comments and I basically ran out of models to choose from.  We have used it for about a month with no problems.  I don't think the coffee is as hot as our old maker.  I would have liked a beeper to go off when the coffee is ready.  Thankfully, the light that comes on when you push the BREW button goes off when you brew just one cup.  At least I can glance at it and know it's done.  I am not liking how the black shows up the dust.  I have to clean it every day or it looks really dusty.  The travel mug is pretty useless as it sort of drips on you when you tip it up too far to drink.  But the extender for mugs is very nice.  We like to make a pot of coffee in the morning, and then just get a mug later whenever we like.  I do love that feature!  I am giving it 4 stars because it is missing a beeper sound when brewing a full pot.",4,2014-01-28,,True,,Very nice coffee maker,,

1391,1,"Love this coffee maker.  I got tired of buying expensive pods for my old coffee maker and this one uses just ground coffee, which is cheaper and more often on sale at the stores.

Well, this solves that problem as well as adding the pot for those days when you don't want to keep making single cups of coffee!<br /><br />Easy to use, fairly quick in brewing. My only problem I've had is that if you dont set it to bold, it makes the coffee weak.. perhaps its the coffee I was using, but aside from that, I have no problems.",5,2015-07-02,,True,,This has turned out to be a fantastic coffee maker,,

1396,1,I love everything about this coffee pot. It is so well designed that each time I use it I notice something that it has improved upon when compared to other coffee makers. The carafe is more of a cylinder shape rather than the usual round bulb shape. This allows you to pour out all the coffee without having to hold the thing upside down like on a tradition Mr Coffee.<br /><br />Having both single server and full pot options are great for when you only need one cup. The tall insulated cup that it comes with is also quite nice. Also comes with an adapter to use softpods so If you are migrating over from a single serve machine you will be right at home. It is not K Cup compatible. Softpods are just pre-packaged coffee pods wrapped in filter paper. They look like small round pillows of coffee.<br /><br />All in all I am very pleased with the machine.,5,2014-12-14,,True,,A machine that gives you options,,

I have no problem with the function.  However, the plastic casing of the machine is cheap plastic.  About a week after it arrived, I noticed that there a chunk of plastic was missing the space behind the pot.  It had been sitting on my counter, not been dropped or anything.

1599,1,"I bought this a year ago and have used it since then. The deciding factor in buying this was the ability to make one cup. I thought I could use kcups but discovered I had to buy pods. The pods were hard to find and I never did find any that hadn't been sitting on the shelf for ages. The coffee in them was always stale. The pot does come with a small one cup filter though to use with your own coffee which is doable. The biggest problem with brewing one cup was that the one cup side of the machine made lukewarm coffee. Because it never got hot enough, the brew was always very weak both with pods and the reusable filter. The temperature issue could be assisted to some degree by using very hot tap water to start with but overall the single serve option was quite disapointing. The caraffe side works well and I ended up making a pot or half a pot for the most part.

I did however notice I have to watch how grounded the coffee is or it will leak threw the filter. The only coffee I can’t make in it is lavazzo Italian coffee grounds. Because it grounded up like espresso. In order to get a full pot of coffee I do over fill the water tank a bit to get a full 12 cups or it brews less. But the coffee is amazing.

The product is very easy to use, easy to clean, no unpleasant smells or tastes. It makes great coffee. Even though it is rather large, it is not bulky and does not take up a lot of space on the counter. The only down side is the gold filter. It's not recommended to use gold filters because gold filters do not remove terpenes, a cholesterol raising component in coffee. Paper filters do remove terpenes. When I use the single serve side, I have to cut a paper filter smaller, which is a little bit of a nuisance, but worth the final result. It would be nice if small paper filters were provided with the product. I highly recommend this product.",5,2016-03-02,,True,,Great Product!,,

I bought the Hamilton Beach 2-Way Brewer for my husband for Christmas.  Today, December 26, I decided to be a good sport and get the coffee maker all set up for him.  This is the first inkling I had that the machine won't take K-cups.  Since I didn't see anywhere in the product description nor in the User Reviews that this was the case, I was astounded! &#34;This Can't Be&#34; I thought.  So, I called the 800 number on the Hamilton Beach User Guide for Customer Assistance.  A very friendly recorded voice told me that they were closed for the holiday and would reopen tomorrow.  Whaaaaaat!  Then I went back to the Answered Questions link on Amazon, and sure enough, it says that the older version of the product only uses Senseo soft pods.  Since I just bought this machine last week, I assumed I had the latest version.  Still shaking my head in disbelief, I put a K-cup in the single serve side and let it rip.  Nope, it didn't work.  Another astounding revelation is that the water reservoir on the single-serve side only holds enough water for a single serving.  Again, this was totally unexpected.  I know, I know, &#34;Caveat Emptor&#34; but there are just certain things that one expects from a coffee machine and this  Hamilton Beach didn't deliver.  (Can you even buy Senseo soft pods anymore?)  I sending this unit back to Amazon today",1,2017-12-26,,True,,Sooooo incredibly disappointed... Beware.,,
1686,1,Be aware that this does not take k-cups!,2,2016-06-08,,True,,Not for k-cups,,
1687,1,"We have had one of these for about 4 years and just love it! It provides very hot coffee whether in the pot or in the single serve and it is so easy to maintain and use! We just love it! Now we bought one as a gift and they love it as well! Would highly recommend it for those that want the option of either pot or single serve without the high cost of the K-cups. Plus if you are looking for hot coffee then look no further, because this serves it very hot! It has shown to be very durable and made to last! For ours we just do the cleaning every once in a while and that is it! It has paid for itself time and time again! Love it and would highly recommend it!!!",5,2017-12-31,2.0,,,Great HOT coffee in the pot or single serve and it is Quality and proven to last!!!,,
1688,1,"This coffee maker is great! I got this for Christmas and have already used it almost every single day (okay, it isn't THAT long yet :)).<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Fast!<br />-Attractive<br />-Coffee tastes great! (Use filtered water for best results!)<br />-Two sides is great! I am really the only regular coffee drinker in the house, so there is no point in brewing a lot of coffee on weekday mornings. I just set the timer, set it to go to the single serving side, and on my way out the door to work, I've got coffee!<br /><br />CONS:<br />-The fill for the carafe side is on the back of the unit, so if you have a cabinet above it, you will have to pull the coffeemaker out to fill it up.<br />-The travel mug lid doesn't screw on. It just sort of sits on the mug. This could result in you spilling hot coffee all over yourself on your way to work.<br /><br />I'll give this 5 stars easily.",5,2014-01-04,,,,Great Coffeemaker,,
1689,1,"Completely died (lights up, but does nothing) in less than 2 years and of course it's out of the warranty, which is only 1 year.  Cool design and looks nice, but quality is terrible.  I wonder how many of the 4 and 5 star reviewers never came back to update that their coffee maker also failed.  $80 every couple of years makes for one super expensive coffee maker.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After I posted my review Hamilton Beach left a comment to contact them for a replacement. However, when I actually called the 800 number they instead offered to sell me another unit at a discount.  After shipping it was going to be $61.  Since the last one died in less than 2 years no way I'm giving Hamilton Beach more $$$.",1,2014-11-02,6.0,,,Broke shortly after the 1 year warranty,,
1690,1,"This plastic junk is like poison. I have a similar one same brand and let me you tell you something... After about year or so, I would start to taste a strange flavor in my black coffee with no sugars... The best way to drink the coffee and if anything is off you will know immediately because nothing is blocking your taste buds from any chemicals that may be released from the plastics as it heat up and degrades over time. I used vinegar to clean this junk thinking it was nothing. So couple days ago I noticed weird strong chemical and I used vinegar again thinking not strong enough. I decided to smell the inside and behold i could smell the same chemical I was sipping on... Disgusting and unhealthy to say the least. I will never again buy coffee maker that use plastic all around... Cheap products made cheaply overseas for pure profit, nothing more nothing less.",1,2018-02-19,,,,This plastic junk is like poison. I have a similar one same brand ...,,
1691,1,"Really like this coffee pot!  Love the option to brew a whole pot or just a cup and cleaning is a breeze.  I really should have gotten the Amazon package deal with the permanent filter so instead I am buying the filter now (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamilton-Beach-80675-Permanent-12-Cups/dp/B0006FJ2RG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamilton Beach 80675 Permanent 12 Cups</a>&nbsp;As per reviews it does fit perfectly so we will see how it works.  Needless to say, if you are going to use the single serve with the cup that came with it, make sure to use TWO pods otherwise your coffee will be coffee flavored water.  The coffee pot is compact, easy to use with only a couple options so there is no confusion and easy to clean.  I have had the same coffee pot for about 10 years and while I kept the old one as a just in case, we shall see how long this one lasts.  The only reason for the one missing star is because the single serve filter is a little strange to fit.",4,2013-11-24,,,,Great Coffee - Great Style - Compact - Easy to Clean,,
1692,1,"First; I'm told NOT to describe our shipping experience, so, I won't, in order to get this negative comment/warning accepted.<br /><br />Second; Waited two weeks before trying-out the coffee maker, today we tried the single serve side first after reading and following all of the instructions first. After pouring the prescribed amount of water in, it immediately leaked like a sieve all over the kitchen counter.<br /><br />I'm told to send it back for a full refund, OK. But, we still don't have a working coffee maker and now we're out almost $10 for coffee we cannot use.<br /><br />Just another example of U.S. branded/Commie Chinese made junk.",1,2017-11-25,,True,,1-Star is Too Much! - Shoulda' Listened to the Worst Reviews,,
1693,1,I’ve had this coffee maker for about 5 years and it’s still working very well.<br /><br />The only minor complain is the water reservoir lid broke soon after purchasing...the plastic pin snapped.<br /><br />I love the flexibility to make a single cup of coffee for me or a carafe when I have visitors.,5,2018-08-30,,,,5 years and still going strong!,,
1694,1,"Bought this as a gift for my mom. Shortly after she got it, it started to not work properly. The amount of water she put in wasn't coming out, it was taking an overly long time to brew, etc. Contacted Hamilton Beach since it's under warranty. They were off no help (check their Facebook page, there are many customer complaints of their poor customer service). Thankfully Amazon came to my rescue.",1,2018-12-10,,,,DON'T BUY,,
1695,1,"All-in-one machine does everything you need. Both sides are programmable. The single-serve side is fast and flavorful, and the cup they include with the machine isn't bad. Not a rugged to-go cup (it doesn't seal the drinking slot), but it's great for keeping coffee warmer, longer, around the house or office. The base on this side also adjusts so you can brew straight into your favorite mug or to-go cup, short or tall. Both sides are easy to fill, and though I prefer detactable water reservoirs, the refill process is surprisingly easy and spill-free. And to top it all off, the machine is stylish on my counter, matching well with other appliances. I'm very picky about coffee makers and shop around (enough to drive my wife crazy sometimes, but she admits I find great products). This was my choice and I'm loving it!",5,2013-11-02,7.0,,,All-in-Wonder,,
1696,1,"This would be a five star review, the coffee maker is hands down the best I've ever had.  However, The spring on the coffee basket &#34;sprung&#34;, and even though I am still using it (til I get a replacement), it's awkward and clumsy.  I found a replacement part at Hamilton Beach, but really!  $7.95 is reasonable, but the cheapest shipping I could get was $13.  Is that insane?<br />Now I am wondering if the basket shown on Amazon would work, even though it is a different part number.  For $3 and change I guess it's worth the gamble.  Please don't let this keep you from buying this wonderful coffee maker.  I use the side thingie frequently, makes about 1 1/2 mugs, just enough to start the day.",4,2014-08-06,,,,Almost perfect.,,
1697,1,too bad this guy didnt leave the travel mug in the box- you cant really use the single brew function without it-  ive had one for years- its worth finding the real one with the included mug- its the best travel mug Ive ever owned. and Im looking for a replacement now that it fell off my motorcycle- Its worth buying a new coffee maker just for that cup!,5,2017-06-21,,,,Make sure you get one WITH the cup!,,

1730,1,"I love this coffee pot. It is easy to use, very quiet, and has a one-cup option.",5,2018-11-04,,True,,So easy to use,,
1731,1,"We've used the carafe side twice, and we've used the single serve side twice, and so far we LOVE this thing. The coffee is flavored just fine, no plastic taste as mentioned by others, but we use filtered water. The water reservoir on the carafe side is easy to fill, and there is no spill-out like there was with our last coffee pot. The brew basket lid gets condensation, but when opened, the condensation drains into the reservoir, so no mess on the counter like there was with our last coffee pot. Water flows through gently so coffee grounds don't get sprayed back onto the dispenser like they did with our last coffee pot. The coffee pot lid is hinged and opens and closes smoothly, so lid is always in the right spot and not a pain to &#34;click in to the right spot&#34; like it was with our last coffee pot. This carafe pours like a dream! So smooth, no drips.<br />Now for the single serve side - This is a bonus, because I wanted something that would give me quick hot water without using the microwave to make formula to mix into my baby's cereal. This thing is amazing. I run one ounce of filtered water through, and within about a minute, I get one ounce (no loss through the system which surprised me) of piping hot water. I mix it with another ounce of cool filtered water, mix one scoop of formula powder in, and voila, perfect temperature warm cereal for baby's bedtime. Hubby used the single serve side for coffee this morning and said it was perfect. This machine is a dream! And no, it did NOT come with Senseo pods, so the reviewers who said theirs came with it must have ordered from a specific seller, not generic amazon order. I will update my review if we ever get around to using pods. But I don't see why we would when we can get a perfect cup of coffee with the beans we've been using for years.",5,2014-11-24,4.0,True,,Buy it!,,

Of course, I should have read the fine print, and did do that, but I missed that detail somehow.  The mugs I have at home did not fit correctly, so I had to buy a new one.  Anyway, I just think that if you are NOT going to include something, then DON'T put it in the picture. Also, you can only brew one side at a time--my husband was hoping he could brew straight into a mug so that would be ready to go when he leaves for work, and on the other side would be coffee to have before he leaves.

1848,1,"Just got it for Christmas, I was surprised at all the great reviews, is why my husband got this one.

1849,1,The poor reviews I see are user mistakes and a few flawed from the factory.

It makes good and hot coffee. Only drawl back I could see is finding the SENSCO coffee &#34;pods&#34; for the single serve side. I live in a rural area and I could not find them in my local grocery stores( like Marsh, Walmart, Meijer). You can find them here on amazon though (kinda expensive). So being the cheap skate that I am I got the Keurig single serve cups. You just open one up and pour the coffee grounds into the reusable/permanent filter and BOOM you have a single serve cup of coffee!!  On the big pot side I have to say it's a little slow finishing a pot of coffee, but then again I'm comparing it to a Bunn coffee pot I use to have. So really it's not that bad. I would recommend it.",5,2013-12-05,,True,,Great coffee pot!,,

1895,1,"I ordered this about a year ago and it worked well, until recently when the small spring mechanism within the filter basket broke.  After that, it was no longer possible to properly load filters and brew into the large carafe.  Now it can only brew single cup servings using the smaller brew basket.  My wife talked to Hamilton Beach customer service and they offered to send a replacement part, but for a price.  So let me get this straight... the product quality is mediocre and something broke after ~11 months, so now we have to pay extra to keep it working?  Sorry, don't think so!  Maybe if it was 2-3 years old I could see the justification, but after barely 1 year there's no excuse for a broken product except for poor quality.  We have chosen not to spend any more money on this unit, and instead cleaned and brought back into use our Keurig brew system.  We didn't always feel great about using the pods, as it seems wasteful, but after 2 years use the Keurig system is still working like new so there is something to be said for that.  It seems of better quality, and it's easier for single servings.<br /><br />I will generously give this product 3 stars because it did work well for almost a year and made good coffee each day.  But hard to believe it broke so soon and a replacement part is not offered for free.  I could almost go down to 2 stars but we'll leave it at that.",3,2017-08-26,4.0,True,,Was good for about 12 months...,,

1899,1,"Love this! The only thing is it takes a really long time to use the single serve, it does a lot of dripping instead of poring, I don't know if it's because you have to add the water each time and it is heating it as it drips out?

NO I WAS NOT PAID TO WRITE THIS, I PAID with my hard earned money FOR THIS COFFEE MAKER MYSELF. Now that we got that out of the way here's my review:<br />I do not miss my Keurig, though they sit side by side on the counter as I was hesitant the first week of use due to some of the reviews mentioned here. The single serve side does take a bit longer to brew BUT that's what the programming option is for. Pop the water and coffee in the night before and set it, and you're ready to go. If you stand and wait it takes probably 3-5 minutes to brew depending on the size of your travel mug. I LOVE the option for brew strength, I also love that I don't have to worry about my coffee 'filtering' through a plastic capsule on its way to my mug. On the weekends I would consume a box of kcups bc I like to drink a few cups Saturday & Sunday...so with that being said I LOVE the pot side feature! This is by far cheaper than a Keurig, also the coffee is cheaper especially if you go to Marshalls, Homegoods, TJMaxx etc, you can get a bag of specialty coffee for $5!!

What's best is that on the weekends, when I make a big batch for my wife, I'm not there putting pod after pod in a Keurig. I pull out the good coffee, grind it myself, and make a whole pot for both of us.

1954,1,"I just ordered this coffee maker in October of last year. Early this morning, I ordered a Ninja Coffee Bar to replace this coffee maker. Prior to owning this model, I owned one of the older model Keurigs, which I got rid of, because after three years of daily use it would occasionally have an issue spraying water or coffee out, which was a nuisance, but still fixable.I decided to go with a different brand because I kind of missed having the option to brew a pot and not wanting to waste a lot of money and further damage the environment by buying k-cups, I wanted to go with a podless system as those refillable k-cups are a real mess and pain. After doing some research, I thought this would be a more affordable alternative. Even though I like piping hot coffee, for some reason, I did not pay too much attention to the negative reviews that stated that the coffee is not hot enough. Big mistake on my part. Technically, my coffee maker still works, but the coffee is basically lukewarm, especially considering that I like to put Coffee Mate from the fridge in mine. Also, 9 times out of 10 I use the single serve side, which often makes a big mess, spraying coffee everything and dripping coffee onto the plate after I move my cup and the brewer shuts off. The few times I have made a pot of coffee, it seems like that coffee is even less warm. I temped my coffee right after brewing recently, and it was only 173 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have done your research, like I have, then you would know that the SCAA recommends that coffee reach anywhere from 195 to 205 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm not the type of coffee drinker who normally notices the way the coffee tastes when brewed in one coffee maker as opposed to another. However, with this machine, the coffee does seem to taste more bitter. Also, it seems like that self-serve side on this machine takes much longer than the Keurig. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone. However, I gave it two stars because it still technically works, I just don't think it's a very good coffee maker.",2,2017-03-18,5.0,True,,"Don't Waste Your Money to Get Bitter, Lukewarm Coffee",,

But I liked the option of a whole pot if I have company in.  That is the thing I didn't like about a Keurig, if I had a group it took a long time to brew 1 cup at a time.  This goes much faster and everyone has hot coffee at all the same time.  Extremely easy to use, even shuts itself off if you forget.

1962,1,"I drink a lot of coffee. My entire life is a healthy balance of coffee in the daytime and wine after 5pm. That's how I survive. I am particular about my coffee - no brown water for me. I like my coffee dark and robust, and I mostly use dark/ espresso roast. I drink a pot of coffee every morning. (10-12 cups) Now that we have gotten that context out of the way, let me describe why I am not a fan of this machine.<br /><br />You cannot put more than 4 scoops of coffee grounds for a full pot of water. It overflows and the grounds end up in your carafe if you put more than 4 scoops. This results in weak coffee, which is undrinkable. I have to use at least 1 scoop of grounds for every cup of water, which means I need 6 scoops in the basket. My solution is to make a full pot in three phases. I add water to the 4 cup level each time and let it run three times until the pot is full. You can only imagine what a waste of time that is. The single-serve option works ok if you like to drink one cup of coffee. I can never be satisfied with just one cup, I need at least a pot.<br /><br />A word of caution about the permanent mesh basket. I got it along with the coffee machine and it is a waste of money. It is worse than using a paper filter. At least a paper filter lets me use up to 4 scoops without overflowing. The mesh basket overflows after 2-3 scoops. I threw it away after the first month.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this machine because it is not for people like me who like a strong pot of coffee. It is a big waste of my time.",2,2017-11-27,4.0,True,,Not for strong coffee drinkers,,
1963,1,"I bought this one because of the mostly positive reviews and being the #1 Best Seller. I've owned it for just over a week and have made at least 3  pots of coffee. First with the Negatives. Cleaning the machine is a little bit of a challenge. It is silver and mostly black in color. So it's difficult to see if the machine is clean inside or out. So I haul it over to my deep sink and spray it out. The machine is fairly large for the counter-top. Almost twice as big as my old Mr Coffee machine. Pouring water from the pot into the reservoir I end up spilling some. I've given up trying to fill the pot from the water dispenser on my refrigerator. More goes on the floor than in the pot. I use a large measuring cup to get water from my refrigerator dispenser and pour the water into the reservoir. There's an inside plastic lip at the top pot which makes filling and emptying very difficult. A couple of times I didn't quite get the pot pushed in all the way (on the burner) and it almost fell out (could of broken).<br />The positives are after running vinegar and water through both sides a couple of times, I've not tasted any plastic taste.

In fact, if you set it to single serve, the 12 cup side will turn on instead. So two ways to turn on the 12 cup side. No way to turn on the single serve side. The single serve side makes a great travel mug holder, but it won't fill your mug with hot coffee. So to summarize, I bought a 12 cup coffee maker. Thanks Hamilton Beach.<br /><br />Update 01/04/2017: Be very weary. The price keeps going down on this. Has gone down $10 since end of 2016. So must be slowly trying to get rid of this product.

I come back and all of the water had leaked out of the housing onto the electric cord, which in return blew my toaster.

I like the fact that the single-serve side has a permanent coffee filter built in that can be used with ground coffee instead of expensive K-cups.

Coffee is steaming hot and tastes great!!! The only  minor negatives are that the single-brew side brews a little slow and continues  to drip after mug is full.

Currently it will only brew half a pot of coffee regardless of how much water I put in the reservoir (where is the rest of the water going?  Your guess is as good as mine.) It also takes​ over 20 minutes to brew this half pot.  That 20 minutes is long enough for the coffee shakes to set in and for inter-house bickering to commence.  (Seriously, 20 minutes for 4 cups of coffee?!  Ridiculous.) It has always brewed slow, but until recently it only took 12 mins for all 12 cups to brew.

The single use side lets granular coffee residue through causing the coffee to be very &#34;muddy&#34;.

Being the awesome husband I am, I donated her old one and bought her the version 2.0 when it came out thinking it would be better. It did nothing but give her fits and bad coffee.. to the point that she just gave up making it in the mornings to avoid frustration and hit starbucks. I can't have that. To my surprise, the amazon reviews on this Hamilton Beach brewer were pretty spot on. She's excited to use it every time, it's hassle-free, easy to clean, and gives a perfect brew every single time.

I mostly use this as a single serve coffee maker but love the fact that when I have people at my house I can brew a couple of cups at a time.  I came from a Keurig which worked great for many years but it brewed a weak cup of coffee.  I even tried the refillable K-Cups where you use your own coffee but it didn't solve my problem.  The Hamilton single serve side is much more versatile than the Keurig.  The coffee filter basket is much larger than a K-Cup which allows you to make your coffee as strong as you'd like.  Making a small, medium, or large cup of coffee is simply determined by how much water you put in the reservoir.  There is nothing fancy about this coffee maker.  It looks great and everything is simple to use.  The travel coffee mug isn't bad but the top is awkward to drink from.

I contacted the Hamilton Beach company,  who told me to clean the single serve side.  I told them,  I already had tried that.  Then they cheerfully told me that the product is still under warranty,  and they will replace it.<br /><br />But first I have to cut the cord off the one I have,  take a picture of the mutilated product,  and send that along with $14.99 to Hamilton Beach,  and then wait 7-10 days after they receive these things to have a new coffee maker sent to me.  With Thanksgiving less than a week away and out of town guests arriving,  this doesn't really do it for me. The carafe side still works fine,  and I can use that for the time being.  With a cut cord,  I will be without coffee for at LEAST 7-10 business days.

The last time I made a pot, the &#34;pause and serve&#34; button broke off the bottom of the basket when I went to go shake it out. I'm apparently not alone in this. Still works fine, even without the button and for those rare occasions that I make a pot, I'm not THAT desperate for coffee that I need to interrupt the brew :)<br /><br />Update: 8 months later, still love it.

The single serve is the same to get a full cup you have to run two to three full cups of water thru.  Don't know where the water goes, up in steam I suppose.

I want to just use a regular coffee mug, so when a regular coffee mug is in place, the coffee comes out of the single serve side and splashes ALL over the coffee maker and the counter.  Poor design.  If you want  to have a regular coffee pot, this would be overpriced, as it has nothing special to be paying $50.",1,2018-05-24,,True,,and a good old fashioned coffee maker,,
2282,1,"Had this been the correct Kurig version I ordered I would have kept it. Instead I got the Sanseo soft pod version as shown. K-cup version dispenses on the right side. No problems with the Amazon return, as usual, but they didn't have the correct pot in stock. Momma had some 20% off Bed, Bath etc., etc, coupons. So I trot over and get the pot there for the same price after the discount. That pot died refusing to dispense the water it was heating from either side. Called H-B customer service, such as it is. The agent tried to talk me through several DIY fixes (all of which I had already tried). I told the agent I needed a replacement pot. I later discovered H-B does not fix anything. Finally, he offered a replacement for a mere $25 shipping charge. I had to cut the cord from the old unit and submit the photo to H-B before they shipped the replacement from Mississippi. Now I live in AL and it took 6 days to get here. I could have driven to MS and back for less than the shipping. My new pot works very well and I hope for much longer.<br /><br />The clock is easy to set. There are no annoying beeps or warnings or cleaning cycle routines like my old KitchenAid that drove me nutty. The display is large, back-light and easy to read. The carafe doesn't drip all over the place when you pour a cup like the KitchenAid or Mr. Coffee. FYI: you may want to use an extra scoop of coffee as this unit seems to brew on the weak side to my taste, but I like my morning stater fluid on the strong side. Momma however, says it's just to her liking. If it lasts, it's a fine coffee maker.<br /><br />Helpful Hint 1: If you like your coffee finely ground, standard coffee filters may overflow the fine grounds into the brew basket. Cure: go to Wally World and buy BUNN Filters-they are deeper than standard and fit the H-B brew basket like a glove and no overflows. I promise.<br /><br />Hint 2: The little nozzle that pierces the K-cup pods can get stopped up with grounds and occasionally the foil cover remains from the pod, too. Use a tooth pick to carefully ream around the inside of the nozzle-DON'T PUSH AS YOU CAN JAM STUFF UP BAD. Just gently scrape the inner diameter of nozzle and try to pull downwards at the same time.<br /><br />Hint 3: Buy an extended warranty from Square Trade. It's cheaper than the $25 shipping for a warranty replacement. Square Trade is way too easy to deal with compared to H-B.<br /><br />Hint 4: Use filtered water. I took my old one apart and even with weekly cleanings (vinegar and water) to descale it was still in rugged shape for a 3 month old unit that makes 3 pots a day.",5,2015-06-04,,True,,Really nice but buy a 3rd party warranty,,

I haven't mastered the preset brew function yet but it's no big deal if I get it ready the night before. My only star deduction was for the water reservoir.

I was skeptical about whether this would make as good a cup of coffee as my previous coffee makers, but my husband and I got tired of brewing pots of coffee and then not finishing them, which often happens in the afternoon. We liked that we could brew a single cup or a pot, depending on the time of day and how much coffee we wanted to drink at that point. This is the perfect solution. It really is like two coffeemakers in one, and both sides make good coffee (although the single brew is realllllly good).

Well we somehow forgot it, and as we opened up the new house I was mortified that I had to again buy a Keurig.  A friend suggested I shop around before dropping another $120 on a coffee maker.<br /><br />The first one I saw was this wonderful machine.  Now I have only had it for a week but I have more than enough replaced my Keurig in my heart.  I LOVED having the one cup ability when it was just me living  by myself.  However now I have a family and a lot going on, a single serve coffee maker is great but sometimes I need a pot and simply can't afford the Keurig Caraffe lifestyle.  So I purchased this HB coffee maker for more than HALF the price of a Keurig and not only is this programmable, but it has a bold button for slower brew stronger coffee.  Unlike with the Keurig, I actually can use this single serve with regular coffee grounds and I get the perfect brew with very little coffee grounds.<br /><br />I am VERY happy with this purchase.",5,2017-02-13,,True,,I forgot my Keurig....and now I don't mind.,,
2363,1,"My wedding gift Cuisinart broke and My husband proclaimed that he was only going to drink coffee on the weekend, so I wanted something simple I could have for my travel mug to work each day and possibly a larger pot for when the Husband decided he needed a cup or we have company.  I would say that it took a bit to find the right combination of grounds and water that makes the best cup for the single serve, but I am generally happy. I think the Cuisinart definitely brewed a stronger and better cup overall and kept it hotter longer than this guy, but since we are drinking less of the full pot, or when we do it is right after we brew it and we don't make seconds then I am still happy with the end result.  The timer works for only one side at a time, which isn't a problem for us.  After I have been using it for several months I found out that my husband decided the travel mug side was so convenient that he started using it too. So of course the battle over the coffee continues.I haven't had any leaks or issues with it. It looks nice on the counter top and brews a decent cup.

I like a large cup of coffee in the morning and Yes it does take a bit longer but the wait is well worth it. You may need to try different amounts of coffee and water to get taste you want.

Then there is a plastic piece that I cut off which then allows me to put my stainless mug directly where the thermos would go.<br />Additionally you never have to buy filters!  You just dump the grounds and immediately rinse the metal filter.  Personally I think this really helps the taste as the oils don't get filtered like they would in paper filters.<br />I have used this everyday for the last 2 years and it hasn't failed yet, outliving any previous coffee maker.",5,2015-12-05,4.0,True,,Greatest coffee maker ever!!,,
2367,1,"I have purchased two of these Coffee pots because I have two homes.  I really liked the idea of being able to brew either a full pot or a single cup.  I had no issues with the single cup side of the machine.  I like the electronics on the machine.  Easy to navigate.  The mechanics of the full cup brewer, however are a problem.  BOTH of the pots I had (as I have had to replace both of them in less than 2 years!!) had issues with the brew basket.  When taking it out to thoroughly wash it, the spring mechanism which causes it to stop brewing when you pull the pot out to pour a cup came apart.  I usually can fix things, but on both machines, the small disc that held it in place broke.  I tried to make my own out of thin plastic from a water bottle, but it was never the same.  I used them anyway simply waiting for the brew to complete before allowing myself any coffee.  However, both of the carafes also cracked when being gently washed by hand.  Since I already had issues with the brew basket, I opted to throw the pot away rather than replace the carafe for $25 each.  I could have kept it to use only the single side brewer, but it took up far too much counter space to keep for only that function.  Good concept.  Poor quality parts.",2,2018-01-28,,True,,Good concept. Poor quality parts.,,

Not using k-cups reduces so much trash.  The bold brew option lets you get the most out of special flavor or gourmet coffees.  Every 2 weeks I run a vinegar cleansing batch.  Quick, easy cleaning has kept this maker working like new.  I'm not a coffee expert, compared to coffee I get at work or restaurants, this reliably makes great coffee.

You don't need to buy the pods, you can use loose coffee or your Kcups to have multiple flavors, you just have to cut the kcups open and dump them in the smaller filter side, and it tastes just the same! So I can continue to buy my favorite kcup flavors.For folks in previous reviews who asked if the single side needs to use the to-go cup, the answer is no.

2375,1,"We got one some time ago, and the heater finally failed. So, we just bought another. The price is right. I read comments about it not using K-Cups, despite the fact the advertising description is pretty clear on that. No K-Cup compatibility! It uses Pods, or loose coffee. So far, we have only used loose coffee, either pre-ground or grind-my-own. Frankly, it works great with loose coffee. I frankly see no reason to waste money on one-size-for-all pods and k-cups. Spooning your own coffee into the single-cup basket allows you to adjust the coffee amount to your taste and also to the cup size. (Also, it is MUCH cheaper than using wasteful little pre-filled containers.) I can buy a 12-ounce package of coffee for $5-$8. That amount of coffee would cost so much more if I were to use pre-filled pods or k-cups. Also, as far as I can recall, filling little k-cup containers that you can buy is a bit messy, and not to be enjoyed. Instead, just use the basket with loose coffee. The carafe side never let us down for preparing up to 12 cups, that is until the heater finally failed. But then, the new pot fixed that! We saved the old pot's carafe in case the new one were to break. We also saved the little single-serve side basket, for the same reason.",4,2017-06-07,,True,,WE liked it and got another.

2409,1,"I have a Keurig but hated the fact that you could never drain the water reservoir, and since my family size coffee maker finally died on me, I was in the market for a new coffee machine. This coffee maker is wonderful. It does exactly what you need, whether it is one cup or for a group of people. I like the fact that it comes with a reusable filter for either sides. If you don't have time to measure your coffee grounds or just like the convenience of using something similar to a k-cup, you can purchase soft pods. Another plus, on the side for making one cup and if you don't want to use a travel mug or don't have one, you can take the drip tray out which than comes apart into two pieces, reassemble them to make a multilevel cup rest. Lastly, you can't beat the price for what it does.",5,2017-03-14,2.0,True,,Great buy for either one cup of coffee or a pot of coffee! Can't beat the price!,,

I had a Mr. Coffee programmable coffeemaker for years and it suddenly started leaking buckets of water so we were forced to get a new one.

2416,1,"Love the idea of it,more than the product it self. I was afraid of the newer model because of the burnt plastic small problem.Saw all the awesome reviews and thought this is the one...I bought this one,and went back to my old Brewstation within 2 months.<br /><br />I love that it cleans up easy,and the idea I want a single cup of coffee without giving up the ability to make a whole pot of coffee.No special cups to buy...Wow what a Brilliant Idea...I'm singing and twirling... The hills are alive...<br /><br />But reality hits...<br /><br />- The single serve side only holds 14 oz's of water,(I use a 24 oz cup) So I have to brew it one and a half to fill my cup,I have to measure the water with a measuring cup perfectly,then brew the full amount,then do it again to fill the cup.I also have to use as much coffee as I do to make a carafe of coffee...Its really not worth the trouble for me,it used so much coffee,and so much of pain of measuring out just the right amount of water.It's easier to make a carafe,and toss what I didn't want.<br /><br />- The Carafe side,is slow brewing,and takes an extra scoop of coffee (as my older brew station) to get the same level of taste of coffee I'm accustomed too...<br /><br />-The carafe side only stays warm for 2 hours...(I have the option of setting my brewstation for up to 4 hours)<br /><br />-I also had to wait till the carafe was fully brewed to,ummm steal a cup,it would overflow the grounds cup,and get coffee & grounds everywhere.I found this out when the pot wasn't inserted once just right in the brewer...<br /><br />- Both sides suffer no beeps,to tell you it's done...no notice.It's still making brewing sounds,is it done? Is it safe to get a cup?<br /><br />After 2 months,of realizing I'm really going through a ton of coffee since switching,and I don't use the single serve side...Why not go back to my old one....I broke up with this machine....",2,2015-04-06,2.0,True,,I had a serious rocky love/hate relationship with it for about 2 months..,,

We like very hot coffee,maybe hotter than most people drink. Temperature of coffee in the pot immediately after brewing was 175 degrees which works well for black coffee drinkers and those who use a little creamer .<br /><br />The single serve side works OK but does not get the coffee as hot as the 12 cup side...especially if you choose to only brew a smaller amount of coffee. I've been preheating the water first in the microwave to increase temperature prior to brewing as I like a little half and half in my coffee but it's still not as hot as I'd really like. Supplied permanent gold filter for single serve side lets a small amount of coffee sediment end up in your cup ( I use Kirkland 100% Columbian which is fine grind coffee) .No perfect fit paper filters available for single brew side although others have been using Melitta #1 cone filter and pods.",4,2016-11-08,,True,,OK alternative to more expensive coffee makers with a few limitations,,

The directions are very straight forward and if you follow them you will never have overflow of either the single cup or the carafe. We did follow the advice of some others on this feed, and brewed 2 or 3 rounds of plain water before using it with coffee. There has never been a plastic or metal taste to any of our coffee.

Like all other drip coffee makers, this model does require maintenance in order to avoid clogging of plastic tubes.

It originally brewed super fast, but as time went on it would take longer and longer, to the point it took 2 hours to brew. Then it just completely stops brewing eventually. This happened to mine after 3 months the first one I had and it happened to my sisters within 2 months after she got hers. I contacted customer service and they replaced it for me, however I needed to pay for shipping which was pricey and provide images that I cut the plug on it. The new one arrived and worked great for a little longer and then as time went on it took longer and longer to brew again and now it has officially stopped working. It’s been just a little over a year and I have now gone through two of these. I’m so disappointed because I loved it at first, but it’s not worth it only lasting a few months. I did try cleaning it and all but nothing works.",1,2018-05-29,,,,Works good until it stops brewing all together and can’t use now!,,
2540,1,"I bought this as a &#34;household&#34; gift for my boyfriend and myself for Christmas. Our other machine was a pain in the butt, and had a reservoir feature that we really liked, but we also wanted the ability to just brew a cup and go. Also, every time his parents come to visit, his father will drink an entire pot of coffee on his own and his mom usually only wants just a cup after dinner or in the morning. I'm the same way; I can have one cup and be happy, but this gives you the best of both worlds.<br /><br />I originally saw this at Best Buy online and it was (of course) like $10 more with them. So I checked amazon and waited on the price and did some more research. This pot has so many benefits and is versatile in that you can use a permanent filter basket (we ended up taking the one from the old machine and put it in this one and it fits perfectly), or a paper filter, and you can also use Senseo pods OR your own grounds for the single serve side. You're not stuck one way or another. We even tried the paper filters to see if there was a difference versus the permanent basket and there's not, it's literally just a matter of personal preference!<br /><br />So the machine...is amazing! It has a 'bold&#34; brew feature that will truly brew it bold (it just takes a little longer, but it made my French Vanilla STRONG). It's simple to use and easy to clean. We have had this in daily use for exactly one month now and have not encountered any issues (save for the little black sugar ants that found their way inside the house and LOVE the coffee maker). I even stuck the pot outside for 2 days when the temperatures dropped to 20 degrees in hopes of eradicating the little pesky ants and I forgot it outside.<br />And then it rained.<br />All over the coffee maker.<br />BUT! It is still working like a champ, with no issues. The boyfriend was convinced it was ruined, but I told him 'not tuhdayyy babe!!'. Hamilton certainly did not let us down.<br /><br />The only drawback I can see to this machine is the area to pour the water in (on the pot side) is positioned slightly awkward, making you have to pour at a certain angle, and that the water reservoir on the single serve side is not clearly marked with a FULL line. But, you can simply fill whatever mug you plan to use (as long as it is no more than 15 oz I believe) with water and then pour it from there.<br />The machine arrive as promised and in perfect condition, and Prime made it even better.",5,2016-01-26,,,,The best coffee machine EVER!,,
2541,1,"I have had this coffee maker for several years and I LOVE it!  I especially love it for its ability to make 1 cup at a time WITHOUT the WASTE of K-cup plastic filling our landfills.  It's very simple to put a scoop of my favorite coffee into the basket and press the brew button!  The dual sides are also perfect for when I have company, and one person wants decaf, while the rest want regular.  I make my morning coffee right into my travel cup - the single serve side is nice and tall to allow for this.  Or if you're making a shorter mug, you can flip over the single serve mug &#34;holder&#34; on the bottom to raise the mug higher, so that coffee doesn't splash everywhere.  Has programming capabilities so that it auto-starts in the morning.  I use a wire mesh basket that I bought at my grocery store instead of filters.

2544,1,"Many years ago, I had a standard drip coffee maker and converted to a Keurig during it's initial popularity. After about a year, I realized how impractical a Keurig was for a 4-5 cup a day coffee drinker, so I went back to my trusty Mr. Coffee. However, it didn't take me long before I missed the convenience of being able to brew a single cup, especially in the evenings. So long story short, for the last couple of years I've had both my Mr. Coffee and my Keurig on my countertop. Not exactly space-saving or aesthetically pleasing, but what's a coffee lovin' girl to do?<br /><br />Hamilton Beach has perfectly married my two needs in one and needless to say, I'm in love. The unit is not nearly as large as I was expecting; it's slightly less cumbersome than my Keurig was on it's own, which makes me and my tiny kitchen happy. The functionality is simple and easy to use - just a flip of a switch and you can toggle between utilizing the full carafe or single cup. I've been into having tea during the evenings and quickly brewing a cup of water water over my tea bags is convenient. I've also noticed the coffee stays much hotter in the carafe than it did with my old drip coffee maker, which is a huge plus. The only con (which isn't really a huge deal, in my opinion) is the plastic smell upon the initial unboxing. It was quite strong and did give me a bit of a headache, but I ran a white vinegar/water mixture through both sides a couple of times and it dissipated; I didn't notice any taste issues, but I can see how this would be a problem for those with extra-sensitive sniffers.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase - especially since I snagged it for $20 cheaper on Amazon compared to Walmart or Target. Win-win!",5,2016-01-22,,,,Coffee lovers rejoice!,,
2545,1,"I have purchased 3 of these coffee makers in the last 3 years. I keep buying them because my husband drinks regular coffee, and I drink decaf. This is the only coffee maker that I have found that gives you these two options plus at a reasonable price.  I returned the first one because the warming plate was rusting, and Bed Bath and Beyond replaced it. I thought it was defective, but the second coffee maker had the same problem. At that time, I needed a new coffee maker for our vacation place, and I purchased the second one. Both coffee makers have broken since then, and I am searching for a replacement, but there seems to be nothing else out there like this. I believe that the popularity of this coffee maker is based on the fact that it has no competition, not on its own merit. The coffee maker at our vacation home broke a few months ago, and the one in our house now only has the carafe side working. I am searching for a substitute since these don't seem to last very long, but there's nothing in the market. I am giving it 3 stars because it is not durable.

2547,1,"We've had this about a month now.  I got a gift certificate for Christmas from Best Buy and was looking for something to buy.  I was using a Cuisanart Grind and Brew for the past 10 years and the grounds holder was starting to pop out on Me.  I was interested in the Keurig coffee makers but my wife didn't want it, the new models will only brew their brands, and usually we want a full pot of coffee.  Then I saw this coffee maker.  I thought great, we can brew our full pot of coffee and still do a single cup (like if someone wants decaf)  We use the single cup side mostly for hot cocoa.<br /><br />I almost took it back at first.  Like some other reviewers mentioned, the coffee had a bad taste and we could smell hot plastic.  I tried different coffees, same problem.  Finally, I checked the cleaning instructions and DID A CLEANING CYCLE with the vinegar.  IT WORKED!  Now we have delicious coffee every morning and a cup of cocoa at night.  If we have guests who want wimp coffee, we have some of the Keurig decaf available.<br /><br />I would have given this five stars if it would grind whole bean coffee, but it doesn't.  I will say that because it does not, it is easier and quicker to clean.  I will also caution that their are some things that take a little getting used to.

One, it isn't limited to just using Senseo pods but can use loose coffee instead, which is much cheaper.  The other was a surprise to me.

2569,1,"Our old coffeemaker died and I agonized over what to get as its replacement.  After reading a bazillion reviews, I ended up with this Hamilton Beach.  We LOVE it!  My husband & I have different morning schedules and it allows each of us to brew a to-go cup in about one minute hours apart.  No more wasting two whole pots of coffee!  And it makes a GOOD cup of coffee...this surprised me, I confess.  I was unconvinced that it could really do that much better than our old one, but it IS impressive.  So far it is genius.<br />I do wish the permanent filter extended to the pot and not just the single cup...but I don't consider that a 'real' drawback.",5,2013-10-24,2.0,True,,Perfect for our home.,,

2588,1,I want to love this coffee machine. I purchased this during a lighting sale thinking it was time to change my machine which was getting old. This seemed like it would be the perfect machine with the option to brew just one cup. It does come with some great features the included filter for the one cup side (I also purchased a separate filter for the coffee pot side). The issue I have and I think someone else mentioned this is that the taste of the coffee from this machine is just ... not right. When I first received it I immediately brewed some water and white vinegar to clean it and ran a couple pots through it with just water. I have used it for a few weeks now and the taste has not changed. Just something not right about it. I don't know it is a plastic taste or something else. Maybe I just need to get use to it and get the right mix of coffee and water but so far... it just doesn't taste very good and I know it is not the coffee.,3,2017-12-20,5.0,True,,Funny taste,,
2589,1,"Love this coffee maker.  Our family all wakes up at different times so I like the ability to make a single cup or a pot.  I actually like the single serve basket more than those pods with the other machines because it allows me to brew the coffee at exactly the strength I like it.  My only dislike is that the mini filter sometimes lets a residue come through to the coffee depending on how finely ground it is. Simple fix, I bought mini filters and they are just right.  I love the design of the product also and it looks very pretty on our counter.<br />The coffee is always delicious and fresh.",5,2017-10-31,,True,,Love it!,,

I was a little worried since I had read reviews that were negative and several comments on a bad plastic taste despite washing. However, I decided to buy this one anyway, since no one was offering the single serve cup in addition to the 12 cup coffee pot portion at an economical price.  I am glad I did.

2591,1,"Great coffee maker.  I was looking for something that could make a pot of coffee on the weekends but a cup for work days.  It works well for what I needed.  I was though surprised that I am unable to find the “pods” to make a single cup at the local grocery stores.  I can order them but there are 4 in my area, big names, and they don’t carry them.  Not a deal breaker because I can just put the grounds in the single cup side and I’m good to go.",5,2018-06-09,,True,,Great coffee maker but pods are hard to find for single cup,,

This machine makes coffee quickly with little issues or error.  There are plenty of features that I don't use (single serving side, timer, warming plate) - I'm sure they'll eventually be useful.  There is a &#34;bold&#34; setting, but it tastes the same as the regular (maybe I'm not cultured enough?).  The travel coffee mug that came with the unit wasn't of the highest quality, but I won't hold that against them...at least they provided one.<br /><br />Overall this is a good coffee maker, I would certainly consider purchasing it again, especially versus single serving/pod brewers",4,2015-06-26,,True,,"Makes good coffee, fast - what else do you need?",,

I am in love! The coffee is stronger and taste so much better. I love that it does a single cup as well as a pot. The single side works for and size cup you are using, simply by using the cup to fill the single side. The single side uses a pod or a mesh filter. It has a adjustable stand for different size of cups/mugs. The pot side is a typical drip style pot. The coffee is a lot better now.",5,2018-02-14,,True,,I broke up with my Keurig for this.,,

2595,1,This coffee maker works great. I like to use the single serve as much as the pot<br />Update: Its been almost a year since we bought this coffee maker and we still love it and we have not had any problems with it. The coffee pot pours great with out it dribbling like a lot of pots do. We found that using a little bigger filter we do not get any grounds in our coffee. We use Bunn 12 cup filters get the ones that are 4.25 inches across the bottom and have 2.75 inch sides. The cheap one from the grocery store are not deep enough and they let the grounds overflow the filter.

2612,1,Worked for about 3 weeks then stopped working. The design of this machine is not good. First if you put too much water in to make a cup of coffee you will get an 'ERROR' signal. You have to put the EXACT correct amount of water in it or it will not work. Second if you are making a cup of coffee you always have to remember to take the glass carafe off the hot plate because it gets hot also. When it worked it was fine but just a pain in the neck getting the exact water amount in to make coffee. Other coffee makers you can fill up and they make just one cup. Also using the coffee pods and then switching to your own ground coffee is a big pain. You have to basically disassemble the piece and rebuild it each time.

Now we make a pot of his coffee (he drinks more of it than I do) and once it is done, I can brew myself a seperate cup of my own coffee. I love it.

2646,1,"This coffee maker does a good job as a combination single cup and full pot coffee maker. I replaced a Keurig coffee maker which I believe are way over rated. They do not make good coffee. I don't care what they claim but a good cup of coffee cannot be made in 1 minute. Plus they are bad for the environment since they require the use of so much plastic and individual pods. I like the fact that you can make a single cup of tea or coffee although I haven't tried the single for coffee yet. I use it for tea and the temp of the water for tea is perfect. The pot side of the coffee maker makes very good coffee. It takes about 10 minutes which takes getting used to after having a Keurig, and before that a Bunn.

We'd pour an entire pot of water in, and it would sit there gurgling for AGES, and finally churn out half a pot of coffee or less. Turns out it's the heat pump or valve some such that died - and a ton of people have also had this problem, judging from reviews.

So far we have been extremely happy with this machine.  The programmable feature is very easy to use and it's nice to have a fresh pot of coffee waiting for us in the morning.  One of the best parts about this machine is the carafe.  It's nice to finally have a carafe that doesn't leak and spill when pouring a cup - the design is great and it's nice to no longer have coffee dribbling out the side or down the front of the carafe when pouring.  Also, there doesn't have to be any special techniques to avoid spilling.  Single cup works great and is fast when you just want to grab a cup and go.  Water is added with the cup, so any size can be made.  We've had it for about 4 months, so not enough to know how long it will last, but so far no flaws!",5,2013-12-20,,,,A coffee maker that I can highly recommend,,

2692,1,"Over 2,000 reviews, here on Amazon alone. Who will see mine? Because I purchased this in spite of the fact that so many criticized the extremely offending chemical plastic smell upon brewing coffee. Since the coffee maker was within a dollar no matter where I checked, I decided to buy at the store so I could open the box and smell as some suggested. Shopped at BB and B because I had a coupon and they also offered a $10.00 rebate. Opened the box and took a deep whiff. Nothing.<br />Brought it home and ran hot water through for the carafe part. No smell. Brewed a single cup with grounds, it smelled old, coffee had been sitting open since we'd started using a Keurig. But no plastic smell. Brewed a single K-cup. THERE IT IS! That awful plastic smell! Smelled the coffee maker and it was definitely there. But why now?<br />I pulled the K-cup out and it was deformed, the sides were wavy. I smelled it, whoa! Bingo! I can't speak for all the users of this coffee maker that experienced the smell, but for me it was clearly the K-cup, not the brewer. This particular one was Eight O'Clock Colombian.<br />So, now I have to experiment with different brands of K-cups and see if some don't &#34;melt&#34; or taste funny even if they do. The instructions also mention that Melitta prepackaged individual coffee packs are compatible and they wouldn't have plastic.<br />I like the fact that this brewer mentioned that it brewed HOT coffee (200' I think I read) to fully extract all the flavors and oils in the coffee. I like hot coffee. But apparently its too hot for some K-cups. I gave it 3 stars because the concept is proven, it is easy to use, it is very quick (I read in some answers to questions that it was minutes to brew a single cup, but its as fast as my Keurig), but I held 2 stars back because of the &#34;melting&#34; K-cup issue. Plan on following up as my experiment provides more info.<br />Follow-up: Well, it's been about 24 hours and I've tried several different brands of K-cups as well one cup-less pod that has just a filter. Every cup of coffee tasted like burnt plastic. The smell in reservoir is increasing in intensity as well as in the grounds basket. I phoned Hamilton Beach and they instructed me to wash the parts in dish soap and then run straight white vinegar through the machine a couple times (have you heard this mantra before?). From the other reviews I knew this wouldn't work. And I pointed out to the HB rep that the reservoir is not removable so I ca't wash that anyway. I've been running the vinegar through the machine all day (no exaggeration) both through the carafe as well as through the single serve side, and that after letting the vinegar soak full strength in the reservoir for an hour. I can still smell the plastic even over the smell of the vinegar. Sigh. Will follow up after thoroughly rinsing and trying another K-cup but at this point, I anticipate having to return this coffee maker.",3,2015-08-06,4.0,,,Too Hot For K-Cups May Be Source Of Plastic Smell,,
2693,1,I have had this coffee pot for a few years.  The traditional side with the coffee pot works great.  The single cup side worked fine when I first got it although the coffee was never really hot.  Now I put a cup of water in and get about a third of a cup of coffee.  I cleaned it regularly with white vinegar but I guess not often enough.<br />I would not but this again.<br />I did not purchase this from Amazon -,3,2017-01-29,,,,It is OK,,
2694,1,Coffee on the carafe side tasted like plastic.  I tried descaling it with vinegar several times and the plastic taste kept coming back after 3-4 pots.  The single serve side worked ok except for the speed (very slow).  Under warranty and my replacement is being delivered today from Hamilton Beach.  Had to pay $11 and change for them to ship me a replacement one.<br />UPDATE 3/6/17 - received replacement coffee maker.  Same exact problem - plastic taste.  Ran vinegar through several times and it gets you maybe 4-5 pots of coffee before the plastic taste comes back.  Piece of junk.  Returned it again to Hamilton Beach and I asked for a completely different model.  The different model I received works fine.,2,2017-02-16,,,,Plastic taste,,

2808,1,There is no water tank for the singe serve side. You have to add water every time you brew a single serve. That is a pain in the posterior because the brewer was purchased for my home office which does not have handy access to water. If you add water it will brew you a cup of coffee.

2810,1,Did not know it was not k cup single compatible,1,2017-04-29,,True,,Not k cup style single,,
2811,1,"This is my first Hamilton Beach product… and it’s a great intro to their line of products.<br />I want to state for the record that I PAID FOR THIS PRODUCT out of my own pocket and I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS ITEM FOR FREE for my honest review as many others state on Amazon these days.<br /><br />Here I am drinking some of the liquid gold from this machine as I write this review.<br />I'll do a little bit of comparison to my last coffee maker, which though it was more expensive, had more features and was older pales in comparison to the coffee it produced.<br />I'm a grinder... not just my teeth at night, but also my coffee. Each day (or night before) I like to grind fresh beans. On my old Cuisinart Grind and Brew (Stainless Carafe Model) I would set up the coffee the night prior to ... um grind and brew.<br />So here's where the comparo begins...<br /><br />The Hamilton Beach Single Serve Coffee Brewer and Full Pot Coffee Maker, 2-Way (49980A) - from here on referred to has the HB or Hamilton Beach obviously does not 'grind' coffee. Therefore, I grind coffee beans at night and set the coffee and time timer before bed, or grind first thing in the AM and start to brew if I neglect to set it up in advance.<br /><br />Both the Cuisinart and Hamilton Beach are 'drip' style coffee machines - meaning the water pours over the basket of grinds and then lazily drips into the carafe.<br />The coffee that comes out of the HB machine is definitely hotter than that of the Cuisinart Grind and Brew.<br />Coffee purists would say coffee should be brewed at lower temperatures, and shouldn't be super hot... well, tell Starbucks that. We ain't buying! Seriously, I prefer a HOT cup of coffee and the HB doesn't disappoint. The coffee is piping hot - not burnt.  It’s not just me by the way… I’ve served coffee from the Cuisinart to company and they too found the coffee to be hot, but not hot enough… my wife would actually heat her fresh coffee in the microwave.<br /><br />The Cuisinart uses a stainless insulated carafe (or there's a glass version) used to keep the coffee at what they feel is optimal temperature. As mentioned above, if the temperature isn't hot enough to begin with, then the coffee in the stainless pot isn't really staying hot enough. Usually within 1-2 hours the coffee would definitely lose heat.<br />The Hamilton Beach has a hot plate that stays on for 2 hours... and keeps the coffee piping hot. As I've drank the coffee over a couple of hours (proper grammar?) I never found the coffee to have burnt regardless of how low down the coffee gets in the carafe. The fact that the carafe isn't insulated is of no matter here. The hot plate keeps it plenty hot the entire time.<br />Another note about carafes - I wrote a review of the Cuisinart stainless carafe over here - http://smile.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REKZ7MH53GRLT/ref=cm_cr_pr_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006F2MI . Over time the carafe picked up a funky metallic taste to it. It looked clean inside (which I did clean it after every use), but something just made the coffee taste bad... to the point where I stopped using the coffee maker all together and began exclusively using a coffee press.<br /><br />The Coffee - So, the coffee is excellent from the HB. I mentioned the odd flavor I was getting from Cuisinart. It's been a while since I had good coffee from that machine, so can't really tell you how they compare in taste anymore. Here instead I'll compare a coffee press for flavor.<br />I've been using a coffee press for years... while my old beautiful Cuisinart sat on the counter unused. I love a good strong cup of coffee...<br />So, I experimented with the Hamilton Beach and my coffee has come out beautifully! I've found 5 scoops of whole beans (which I obviously grind) make a good 8 cups of strong coffee on 'bold setting'. I've also gone with 9 cups of water on 'bold' setting and it's come out with a nice flavor, but more of a 'standard' coffee strength.  Since buying the HB I haven't made a single pressed coffee... It's been that good!<br />Oh, also the Cuisinart has ‘filters’ to put in the water reservoir to filter the water. Replacement water filters are costly and honestly I didn’t notice a difference with or without them. The HB doesn’t require any such water filters.<br /><br />Single Serve coffee.. obviously the Cuisinart only made a pot of coffee - so can't compare here.<br />There’s a switch on the front of the HB machine to switch from full pot to single cup. Easy to use…<br />I've used the single cup maker on the HB and the coffee is equally as good as the full pot setting. 2 scoops of whole beans to the 'max fill' of water and you're all set. Perfect cup-o-Joe.<br /><br />Cleanup - a key component to coffee makers is cleanup.<br />The Cuisinart, by it's nature is a pain in the bum to clean... the grinder portion would get moist while brewing and cause the coffee to stick in all sorts of places. The grinder is removable for washing but requires a brush for cleaning and even then you'll probably still miss some sticky sludgy grinds. The machine itself would also have grinds in it which were almost impossible to clean.  The basket door on the Cuisinart was kinda cool the way it opened up, and easy to clean, but you’d find grinds all around the basket inside the door as well.<br />The Cuisinart pot/carafe itself - not so easy. It had a special type of carafe shape to keep the coffee hot, but no way to fit your hand inside to clean it. Had to use aforementioned brush for cleaning the inside, and even then was still hard to get around the inside of the pot. The top of the carafe here is also impossible to clean entirely. The coffee grinds sometimes thick and stuck to the top, and the little flap that opens to let out coffee is hard to get inside of to clean.<br /><br />The HB is super easy to clean.... The basket comes out and with a rinse you're done. The pot also is easy. You can reach in with a sponge (or perfect for this pot is a scrub daddy if you're into that sort of thing) and that's it. I'm more of a purist, so no soap... (I don't let the coffee sit all day though). The top is easy to scrub too...<br />I use a wire mesh filter. The same one from the Cuisinart fits in this pot and I love how easy they are to clean. Yes, it’s one more piece to clean up – so if you’re a paper filter person more power to you. I prefer the mesh filter personally.<br />The single cup portion comes with a mesh filter already… so you have to clean that bit regardless, but works just as well as the filter for the full pot side.<br /><br />The coffee maker is EASY to set the timer on – both were simple in that regard. The Cuisinart had a setting for 1-4 cups of coffee which in theory was to make the coffee hotter – since less coffee cools quicker. I always set it for 1-4 though I didn’t notice a difference in temperature.<br />Along with a timer the HB has a ‘brew options’ setting which allows you to select ‘bold’ coffee. I honestly think the coffee does come out ‘bolder’ when this option is selected. More than likely it pours the water more slowly over the grinds to allow it to soak in more.<br />The button labeled ‘brew options’ is kind of silly as the only option is ‘bold’. The button should just be labeled as ‘bold’ and that be that… Still doesn’t take anything away from the machine.<br /><br />The Cuisinart is much smaller in overall size. It stands nice and tall and stainless all around. It looks very nice on the counter top.<br />The HB is BIG. Yeah, it’s definitely wider from side to side and takes up more room on the counter. I suppose the additional single cup portion is an entire coffee maker unto itself which adds to the size.  On the other hand, this coffee machine looks beautiful as well.<br />It’s nice looking on the counter and it lights up with a nice blue glow!!! Something the Cuisinart lacked in. Incidentally, the Blue glow happens to match nicely with the Blue glow from my Panasonic microwave (which I have yet to review)<br /><br />Price – The Cuisinart costs a lot more for a coffee maker that doesn’t have nearly as nice an output of coffee! End of story. (Down to $85 at the time I’m writing this review but a lot more when it was new)<br />The Hamilton Beach at the time I purchased was $49… but seems to have gone up to $79. Value of this Hamilton Beach machine is excellent! The quality of the maker itself is great and not flimsy and looks and acts like a coffee maker worth much more.<br />The Stainless portions are only in the front – the part facing out on the counter. More stainless on the back would most likely add cost and in my opinion is completely unnecessary.  Not sure why the price increase or how I got so lucky on price when I purchased, however I would still purchase at the current price of $79!<br /><br />Nice to haves –<br />Kind of wish the HB would beep when the coffee was ready. Yeah, you can take the carafe out at any time during the brew cycle to enjoy a cup, but still would be nice to know it’s done. Not a deal breaker.<br />The Cuisinart did beep upon completion of brewing.<br />Another thing that would be nice – though probably cost a lot more would be a sensor that automatically knows if you’re using the single cup side or the full pot side. It’s simple to switch over anyway.. but if one is making wishes…<br />Some folks reported getting a Stainless Travel Mug with their machine, or some free coffee pods. No Travel Mug comes with this… no coffee pods come with this. Not sure what model they’re referring to, or what year they may have purchased.<br />Would be nice to have a ‘buy-up’ option for a Travel Mug made specifically to fit the size of the ‘Single Serve Side’ of this machine.<br /><br />Overall I give this machine 2 thumbs up and a great review. Not only by comparison to the Cuisinart, but on it’s own merit this coffee maker makes great coffee, is easy to use, easy to clean and looks great – all at a fair price.<br /><br />Sharing some photos - hard to get the 'blue' light in these pictures so you'll have to take my word for it.<br />Also shown in my photo's is the Breville BCG450XL Conical Burr Grinder which I Love and has been going strong since 2011. You can find my review of that product here - http://smile.amazon.com/gp/review/R13VFBNCROYU7X?ref_=glimp_time_1rv_cl<br /><br />Update March 4, 2016 - Still love it!<br />This coffee maker varies in price from week to week. It was up at $59 a week ago and at $49.99 again today (like when I purchased in Dec.). I've seen it in the mid $60's as well... So, depending on when you're looking/reading you may want to add to your cart and wait for it to come down to $49.99 again.<br />Just ordered a 2nd one for my beach place!!!<br /><br />R",5,2015-12-21,7.0,,,"This coffee maker makes great coffee, is easy to use, easy to clean and looks great – all at a fair price.",,
2812,1,"I just bought it from jet.com not too long ago for about $45 using Amex discount. I am frankly in love with this machine.<br />I use the single-serve side 90% of the time since I am the sole coffee drinker in the house. The 12-cup side gets used occasionally when we have guests over. I am glad I did not have to buy a separate machine for my 10% use.<br /><br />Good:<br />- Single-cup side comes with a permanent mesh filter which is quite good in quality<br />- Single-cup side also has an add-on included if you like to use pods (not k-cups though)<br />- The BOLD option brews strong coffee - you can turn it off if you like. When turned off, the coffee is still quite strong, but slightly weaker than the BOLD option. If you like weak coffee, I suggest just putting less coffee in the filter.<br />- Single-side has a way to put smaller mugs - the bottom part can be inverted to lift the mug up, so coffee does not spill all over when it brews into the mug. Love this feature.<br />- Overall quality is quite good.<br /><br />NOT-SO-GOOD:<br />- No permanent filter basket for the 12-cup side. You can buy one from Amazon for around $7 though.<br />- Filling water from the top on single-side is not easy. I occasionally find myself pouring water and spilling it onto the machine a bit. It's a minor complaint, not a deal breaker though.<br />- Did not come with the travel mug pictured in the listing. Fortunately I have several lying at my home from the days when Gevalia used to give several free goodies :-)<br />- No k-cups, no bean grinder. None of this was advertised, so it's not really a disappointment. I knew what I was buying, and it met my needs.",4,2016-01-14,2.0,,,"Perfect machine, meets my needs.",,
2813,1,"Let me start by saying I really, really want to like this coffee pot. I'm a bit of a minimalist and try to research things well before I buy so I don't end up with just another ok item. That said, we've had it for four months now, and I'm just not impressed. I bought it for the single cup function, so I honestly can't comment much about the quality of the full pot. But the single side? The coffee is weak. And cold. I've tried a few different types of coffee now, and nothing has helped. I've tried filling it to the brim with grounds, and experimented with just how much I can put in before they overflow. The coffee is still weak. It's pretty warm when it comes out--drinkable right away, which I guess works if you drink it black. But add a little cream? It's cool enough that some days I pop it in the microwave for a little more oomph.",3,2015-10-19,8.0,,,A little disappointing,,

I was glad to see it on sale here and just purchased a like for like replacement. I think 5 years of daily use (sometimes multiple times a day) is a good life for a coffee pot.<br /><br />Programming is very easy. We use that function every night. The only downside is that only one side can be programmed at a time, not a big deal. But, it would be nice to be able to program the pot for one time and the cup for another. It washes up nicely and fills easily.",4,2018-02-01,,,,Great coffee maker.,,

For years I have tried to master taking one cup to go for work, but always have ended up having some wasted coffee leftover. On weekends and my days off though my household devours a whole pot. This is truly the perfect solution and it makes delicious coffee!<br /><br />It takes up just slightly more counter space, but the machine looks very nice and well made. While this version did not come with the cup I found that it easily fits all of my mugs and to-go cups.

I prefer to use the paper filters for convenience, for both single serve and a pot of coffee in place of the gold filters.

One thing to note: There is a toggle switch to switch between the single up and the carafe brew. If this switch gets moved to the wrong setting (say by the housekeeper which has happened to me twice) the automatic programmer will not have your coffee ready as expected.

2876,1,I've used it now for a few months and love it.  I use the single cup setup mostly and it is very important to be able to clean out the coffee basket after each use with as little effort as possible.  The filter basket provided doesn't need a paper filter or a &#34;pod&#34; - you can just put your favorite grind directly into the single-serve basket.  The basket is really easy to clean afterwards.  You just tap the basket upside down in your trash can and 98% of the grounds fall out into the trash.  Then you just rinse out the rest in the sink.  Easy. The mult-cup basket would need a standard paper filter.<br /><br />Coffee tastes fine and comes out consistently.

It's ability to make either a single cup or a pot is perfect, whether you have guests or it's just a rush out the door in the morning for one.  I mean, this thing brews quick!<br /><br />The thing just looks really good on my kitchen counter for one.  It is a device we use daily and therefore ease of use was paramount in the decision to purchase it.  Now, most people would agree that Keurig is easiest.  Put the k-cup in, press down, press one more button and voila.  I'm just not a fan of the way they &#34;serving size&#34; your coffee.  There's a small finite space in the cup of theirs, and lemme just tell you, some days it's just not strong enough.<br /><br />Now sure, you can get the &#34;stronger brews&#34; (if you're willing to pay a premium) but here's the thing about this one, it is versatile and adjustable to the way you prefer your coffee.  Feeling not so good today?  Add a bunch of coffee grounds to the filter for single brew.  You're not limited to what the company thinks the &#34;average Joe&#34; would prefer (coffee puns!)<br /><br />Anyways, set up is super simple, and that includes it's auto brew settings.

Initially the Bold light function would stay lit and work fine. We noticed that the times we used the program function the coffee was always coming out weak. The bold function would turn off. We turned the function back on and made a pot ""manually""and it turned the light out when complete but still made weak coffee. Suspecting the logic was messed up we unplugged the coffee maker and waited, plugged it back in and the clock readout was 19:00 not 00:00 as before. We made a pot manually and still weak coffee. I unplugged again waited and then back in the clock was now at 00:00 and we made a pot manually w/the bold setting and it worked but still turned off the bold light at the end of the cycle but did make bold coffee. We've decided to just use the pot in the manual mode for now and it seems sometimes the bold light goes out and sometimes not but regardless makes bold coffee. The difference between bold and weak is how many and which water drip holes are used/selected. As an electronics tech by trade I just trouble shot this since It looked like a typical ""confused"" logic problem. We are still keeping an eye on how the pot works and basic symptoms but wanted to shed some light as I didn't want to just throw it out and the symptoms were curious to me.",3,2018-09-20,,True,,Programming issues after power outages,,

That was a hard convenience to give up. However, it was a pain to keep as clean as we would have liked, and we went through four of them due to quality issues. I never thought I would love another coffee maker, but now I do. We love the uniqueness and convenience of the one cup brewing side. It also allows you to place part of the once cup base upside down to raise the height for smaller cups.

I drink a ton of coffee, and was getting tired of paying for k-cup prices so my Wife and I decided to buy a new coffee maker.  After much research on and off amazon I found out that this maker was the best.  It has a full size slot for the tumblers and also height adjusters for smaller ones.  The single serve tumbler also comes with a gold tone filter which makes for super fast coffee runs and clean ups.  The main maker makes 12 cups total and takes about 2-5 minutes to coffee depending on how much you make.  The front panel is super easy to use and when you are ready to make coffee you either select single server side or main coffee maker with the front switch.  The blue light turns on and stays on until the warmer completes its cycle.  Its plenty long for keeping coffee at the perfect temperature until you are ready to drink it.  The water fill is easy to use you make a 1/2 turn of the machine lift the water cover and fill it no spills no mess design.  The coffee maker also has a setting for regular or bold coffee brewing which is nice option, I use the bold.  The coffee maker size is perfect height and width, its about 2.5"" taller than a k-cup coffee maker and about 15"" wide.

I do not have splatter issues as it brews, and it barely has dripped on the hot plate when I have pulled out the pot after brewing.  I also am not having issues with steam pouring out as it brews.  I do wipe up any drips immediately before returning the pot, and I have had few needs to clean the unit since buying it four months ago.

2967,1,"Overview:<br /><br />Outstanding machine. After dealing with the wasteful K-cups and rock-bottom lousy engineering associated with Keurig machines--the mediocre coffee, the constant de-scaling, the Space-Shuttle-at-liftoff pump noise--I gave this Huntington Beach 2-Way brewer a try and LOVE it.<br /><br />Use:<br /><br />I grind my own beans, sourced from the highly-recommended SpecialtyJava.com, with a Bodum Bistro Burr mill grinder but any ground coffee will do. You simply pour the grounds into the single-serve metal-mesh basket on the left side of the machine. This convenient and relatively robust basket means no bleached coffee filters in landfills or carcinogenic (polychlorinated) dibenzodioxin/dibenzofuran combustion bi-products produced during their incineration.<br /><br />Once you supply the coffee grounds, you fill your favorite mug with however much water you want, pour it into the single-serve reservoir, and hit the start button. Within a minute or so--voilà!--you have a fantastic cup of coffee.<br /><br />Cleaning:<br /><br />Cleaning of the Huntington Beach brewer is easy, too, without the outrageous din from the pump the user is subjected to with the Keurig line.<br /><br />Reliability:<br /><br />I've had the same Huntington Beach unit for two YEARS and it's been 100% reliable. My Keurig, in contrast, was junk. I was constantly &#34;de-scaling&#34; it with white vinegar to keep it functional and no amount of rinsing seemed to prevent the first or second post-cleaning cup of coffee from tasting like, well, white vinegar.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br /><br />I'm a huge coffee snob and this brewer is the one to go with for single-serve taste and convenience. I'm buying a second for my office break room. Five stars!",5,2015-04-11,2.0,True,,Convenient and reliable coffee maker that's vastly superior to the Keurig line.,,

I tried everything I knew of to make a decent pot or cup of coffee and it still just came out tasting like warm, slightly flavored water.  No body at all, not using finely ground coffee, using the darker brew setting, different types of coffee or anything else. I don't know if it's the design of the basket or the flow not staying on the grounds long enough, but no matter how cool it looks or what features it has, if it doesn't make good coffee, forget it!",2,2016-01-31,,True,,Crappy coffee from this maker,,

As a college student, I needed something which could provide a quick cup for busy days, or a full pot for long nights. This looked like it fit the bill.<br /><br />Initially, I wasn't impressed by the mostly plastic construction, and expected the machine to fall apart after a month or so. However, after over six months of daily use, this thing's still trucking along, and has proven to be a useful aspect of my daily routine.<br /><br />Machine includes reusable filters for using your own coffee grinds, which thus far works just fine - no grains in my coffee, and clean-up is quick and easy.<br /><br />It's nothing fancy, but it gets the job done, and sometimes that's all you need.",4,2016-07-29,,,,"Simple, effective, reliable.

2986,1,"I actually bought this as a gift for my brother, but he had already bought himself a Keurig. I have a simple, small 1-cup coffee maker so I thought I'd keep this one for myself. I filled the reservoir with water and put in a K-Cup (I got the one for K-Cups not pods). It flashed an error. The 1-cup side will not work with the reservoir full. To empty the reservoir you have to run all the water out through the carafe side. OK, so I did that. I put a coffee cup amount of water in the reservoir. I set the timer. It did not work. The timer only works with the carafe side. I'm the only one who drinks coffee in my house. I make a cup in the mornings to drink on my way to work. I don't need a full pot of coffee. It also does not come with the to-go cup. I packed it back up in the box. Not sure if I'm going to return it or save it for a gift next year.

3020,1,"This is a great, easy to use machine. Definitely not professional quality, but as good as any similarly priced coffee maker. I love the that the single serve side has a built in filter, I just wish the full pot side did as well. I also would like if there were a tank for the single serving instead of having to fill each time with water, but by filling with water I have more control over the coffee/water ratio so it kind of evens out.

3021,1,"I love the design and the promise of flexibility that this machine offers, but the plastic pieces inside are still off-gassing and we've been using the coffee maker daily for a year. I think it's the plastic tubing that the water is drawn through once it's heated. It leaves the coffee with a chemical and plasticky taste.<br />When we first got it, I cleaned it as much as possible. The smell and yucky taste were still there, so I ran a few cycles of white vinegar through both sides. That didn't work either, so in desperation I ran an entire bottle of vodka through the machine.<br />Running the vodka through helped a bunch, but not completely -- I still taste plastic and chemical flavors in my coffee unless I make the brew very strong. I simply don't use the single-serve side because the plastic taste is stronger on that side.<br />If you're not willing to taste plastic in every cup or to spend an ungodly amount on vodka to run through the machine until the taste is gone, then you'd be better off buying something else.",2,2014-11-17,2.0,,,Nice design but horrible plastic off-gassing,,
3022,1,"We LOVE this coffee maker!  We had an older Keurig that had finally kicked the bucket and had already decided to kick the wasteful/garbage dump filling K-Cup habit and go with a &#34;regular&#34; coffee maker.  My husband and I were so excited to find this option with both a full pot (for the weekends) and single cup (for the weekdays on the go), but honestly skeptical about how well it might work or how good the coffee might taste.  Let me tell you - HUGE improvement in flavor and functionality (because of the full pot option K-Cup didn't have at the time...) over the K-Cup maker and it's still just as easy to use.  We love to grind our own coffee and use the reuseable filters for the single cup and carafe side.  Going strong on several years now and are assuming the coffee maker will probably last at least another couple years (hopefully many more!).  If you're looking for something that makes more than coffee, this probably isn't for you - but if that's all you're looking for (with the HUGE bonus of single cup or pot), I'd take this over a Keurig any day!",5,2015-06-17,,,,"Great functionality, easy to use (MUCH better than Keurig if you're looking for coffee only)",,
3023,1,"We owned a K brewer for 3 yrs and when it suddenly stopped turning on, we were forced to get a new coffee maker PRONTO.  I was in Staples and saw this coffee maker and was intrigued!  I refuse to ever buy another K brewer due to its poor quality and high price.  Since we sometimes need to serve 12 cups, I had needed to keep another drip maker in my cabinet.  Now we have one coffee maker to do both single-cup and carafe amounts.  We are very happy with this HB coffee maker!

I love using my own grounds or a K-Cup. I had an expensive Keurig before and it just didn't make enough coffee for us. This is a versatile machine and I haven't had any problems with it. I have not had any issue with any plastic taste. It also isn't a huge machine and fits on my counter nicely. The current Amazon price is great. I saw it at Target today for almost twice the price. I didn't give it 5 stars because the K-Cup's don't always come out great. You have to make sure to insert it correctly and select the &#34;k-cup&#34; option on the dial. I've found using my own grounds in the single serve basket to be more cost effective and better tasting. The carafe does drip quite a bit when I pour a cup of coffee, but nothing too bad. I just wipe it up with a paper towel.",4,2016-10-19,,,,Versatile and brews great.,,

Unlike the weak coffee from my mom's speedy Bunn coffee maker, this HB makes us a rich brew every time. No need to waste money on  double filters or extra scoops of coffee w this HB.<br />2. Single mug option: the resulting coffee is always the perfect temp! I can use my favorite coffees and not purchase pricey k-cups. The included filter works great! I rinse it between uses and run it through the dishwasher every few cups.<br />3. The 12 cup side: the burner keeps the coffee PIPING hot! I haven't noticed a burnt flavor even after the coffee has been on the burner a few hours. I love that the HB makes 12 cups.

It turns out that I chose really well when ordering this coffee maker because it has been going strong for three years!<br /><br />We get a lot of use from both sides of this machine.  On the weekend mornings, when we are both drinking coffee, we use the large carafe.  During the week, we each use the single-serve side.  At night, my husband usually has tea and I have hot chocolate.  We use the single-serve side when preparing both because it heats the water up so quickly, but doesn't get the cup handle hot (like a microwave does).<br /><br />There is one travel coffee mug in my entire cabinet that is tall (it's from Starbucks) and it is the only one that doesn't fit easily on the single-serve side.  To make this one coffee mug fit, we have to remove the little tray and actually sit the mug down into the gap, then it fits fine.<br /><br />One thing I've learned when using the single-serve side is to use a cup with a spout to pour the water in.

I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he wanted more from his coffee pot than what our old one had. This coffee pot has so many cool features that I will probably forget to list some here. The first thing that I found to be really neat was the single cup feature. You can brew up to 14 oz for a single cup. There is a small reusable filter included or you can use &#34;pods&#34; in it. The carafe is a standard 12 cup pot. The lid is easily removed for cleaning. We've put all the parts that come out into the dishwasher (top rack) and they did very well. The 12 cup side doesn't come with a reusable filter, but they do provide some paper filters. There is a clock, and self brew mode for each of the sides! I thought this was just awesome! My husband and I work opposite shifts so it is way more economical for us to brew single cups.

3112,1,"I've been using a &#34;dumb&#34; drip coffee maker for my entire life and though it might be time for an upgrade. I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />This model is NOT compatible with K-cups, but since I haven't used them I don't miss that feature. There is another similar model that now also works with the K-cups, if you're looking for that.<br /><br />This machine uses regular grounds - which is what I use - or also the Senseo pods on the single serve side. I love that I can use either the full pot or the single serve, and that I've finally stepped into the 21st century with a programmable coffee pot. I can't tell you how amazing it is to have coffee ready by the time you wake up! The programming feature works with either side of the pot - you just have to flip the switch to the side you want to run. (Side note: You can't run both sides at the same time.)<br /><br />A couple of notes and tips about this coffee maker:<br /><br />1. It does come with a reusable filter for the single-serve side, but not for the full pot side. They offer it for sale, and it does come with a couple of paper filters, but otherwise, you're on your own for filters on the full pot side. (I may purchase the reusable filter for that.) Using the reusable filter is more eco-friendly and saves a little money. (More to spend on coffee!) I just rinse it out after use and let it air dry for a few hours before popping it back into the machine and resetting it for the next morning.<br /><br />2. The instructions for raising up the cup on the single serve side aren't entirely clear. There's a two-piece insert that you can flip over and stack to get your mug higher if it's a shorter coffee mug, or drop into the bottom in one piece if it's a larger mug. For extra-tall mugs, remove the inner piece and place the mug directly into the opening. I didn't understand how the riser worked and thought I was missing a piece, so hopefully someone else will benefit from my fail.<br /><br />3. If you use coffee syrups like I do, you have two options for adding them to the single serve side without splashing hot liquid all over the place: a) pump the syrup into the mug directly before placing it below the drip, or b) pump syrup into a different glass and then pour it into the mug. Here again, I hope you can learn from my (painful) fail. I didn't want to leave syrup in the mug overnight to collect dust, so I pumped it into the mug after the coffee brewed - and the result was a hot, sticky mess. And not the good kind.<br /><br />4. After brewing, I open the lids to the water reservoirs to let them air dry. Leaving them closed all the time can lead to mold or other ick forming on the inside.<br /><br />5. It does take up a little more counter space than my old dumb coffee pot, but if you've got the space, it's worth it!",5,2016-11-28,2.0,True,,The Little Coffee Pot That Could - AKA Love It!,,

3118,1,"We've had this coffee maker since Christmas 2015.  It works great.  Both sides work well and we're very happy with the coffee and the features.<br /><br />Unfortunately, something happened with the top cover.  That is, there are two covers on the top; one in the back is for the water reservoir and one in the front covers the basket for the grounds. The front one snaps to the frame and the back one snaps to the front so they have a common hinge axis.  Unfortunately, something happened and the front piece broke at the left hinge side  connection.  So it doesn't stay attached.  And since it doesn't stay attached, everything on top flops around. This isn't a huge deal.  The coffee maker still works perfectly. But it's one of those little things that will grate on me for the next ten years because I'm not going to replace the coffee maker for that, but I can't fix it either. They don't sell replacement parts for those covers.  I checked their website and I called their customer support.

This coffee maker only had to be cleaned one time before use and doesn't taste like plastic - which was a big concern for us after having a different model.  I will say that the lid of the carafe smells AWFUL - like a garden department chemical smell.  If the pot sits on the warming plate too long it will really start to smell.  The single brew side of this coffee maker has it's own separate reservoir for water, so it won't give you the error messages you see on the 49983 model.  It also doesn't brew anything close to smelling like plastic and is fairly quick.<br /><br />I would give this coffee maker 5 stars if the carafe didn't smell so bad when it got hot.

3120,1,"This is a very overrated coffee maker. I received this as a gift because I read all the wonderful reviews about the single cup ability and requested this coffee maker. To all the people that rave about the single cup feature, you all must like a very weak cup of coffee. The directions specifically say do not use more than two level tablespoons in the basket or it will overflow. As far as I am concerned two tablespoons of ground coffee an for an 8oz cup produces dirty dish water not coffee. Secondly the carafe has a top the doesn't separate from glass making it uncomfortable to wash and impossible to turn upside down to drain dry and difficult to get a towel inside to wipe dry. I was happier with the Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Central 12 Cup that unfortunately got crushed in moving out of state.

Well now that I have it I use it all the time. It shuts itself off after 2 hours so you don't have to wonder if you forgot it on when you leave the house.

Maybe it got hit hard once when I put it back. But other then that this has been an amazing coffee maker. Wether you want a single mug or a full pot. It all works great for me.,5,2018-12-01,,,,Love this.,,
3124,1,"We have had this coffee maker for a couple of years now, and it has been fantastic! I love that you can make single cups for on the go, mugs of coffee when you're staying home, or a pot of coffee when you have company.  The base of the single serve side flips over to make it taller to accommodate different size cups.  The scoop filter on the cup side is also very handy - it even has suggested levels for how much coffee to put in for a mug or the cup that comes with it.  I would give it 5 stars were it not for a couple (minor) issues.<br /><br />The markings on the carafe don't seem very accurate; when we've made a pot of coffee for company, we have always had to make extra because we seem to run out; I don't think it is actually a 12-cup pot.  More like 9-10.  The cup side of the machine comes with a permanent filter, but the carafe side does not.  It would have been very simple to include one.  However, we haven't had a problem using paper filters, either.<br /><br />We had a Gevalia Coffee Maker (http://www.amazon.com/Gevalia-Coffee-85188-14-Cups-Maker/dp/B009OWKA5A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1429795761&sr=8-2&keywords=gevalia+coffee+maker+for+two) prior to owning this one, and we much prefer the cups that came in that.  The lids fit tightly and the cups don't have any protrusions inside.  The cup that came with this coffee maker has a plastic piece that stick up in the bottom of the cup.  This is not a problem for drinking out of, but makes it a pain to clean it.  The lid also fits very loosely.  Other than that, they are basically identical, so we just use the old coffee maker cups in this machine and keep the one that came with it as a backup if both of the others are in use.<br /><br />It creates a lot of steam on the top of the machine when using the carafe side.  It creates some on the cup side, too, but not as much.  Might want to be careful when choosing where to place this so it doesn't create an issue with cabinetry.  While we have used the &#34;bold&#34; setting, I don't know that it does that much.<br /><br />It is EXTREMELY easy to set the clock and program this machine! That has been a great bonus to having it, and something that we have never had on coffee makers in the past.  Overall, this coffee maker is absolutely great.  It is a better alternative (IMHO) to the other single-serve machines because you can customize the amount of coffee you put in it, or even use the little pods, and it is much more economical.  We haven't had any issues (other than the steam) since using this.  When we notice that it doesn't seem to be making coffee as well, we just follow the cleaning instructions and voila! Back to normal.  I would recommend this to anyone that has occasional company while wanting the convenience of single-serve options.  It is affordable, easy to use and operate and very intuitive.",4,2015-04-23,,,,Our favorite coffee maker to date!,,
3125,1,"It brews coffee.  My husband drinks alot of coffee.  I got it for him for his birthday last year.  A couple weeks ago it started taking a looong time to brew, like a couple hours.  Also you lose alot of water, for example we pour in 12 cups of water but it only brews 6.  We are going to look into getting a new one unless I can reach the manufacturer.  see I also ordered a 2 year protection plan with it (by checking the box for optional 2 year warranty) it read that it &quot;shipped&quot; seperately from the coffee maker but it comes by email not mail.  So if you order the protection plan check your email.  Mine did come, I didn't look in my email until this month, it was in my spam box.  I just thought it never arrived in the mail.",2,2017-01-24,,,,Takes forever to brew doesn't brew amount of water you put in,,
3126,1,"I liked my old coffee maker-Mr coffee, stainless, simple and made hot coffee.  It died on Sat morning.  I ran through the AMAZON reviews, but found it nearby at Target.  Did not want to wait 2 days or pay extra for 1 day shipping.<br />This machine is awesome.  Coffee tastes great and HOT.  Brews quickly and accurately (meaning not to strong and not too weak).  Trying to find something wrong with it, all I have come up with is that I prefer it in a less SHINY black- like my old one.<br />One of the things I love the most is that the clock/timer is not always lit up.  I always unplugged the old one, mostly because it was so bright.<br />If you are in the market for a new coffee machine, this is the one.  Makes HOT coffee and can make a single serving at the same time.  sometimes I like a different flavor or just on the run and can make 1 cup.<br />AWESOME",5,2013-10-28,,,,Best coffee maker ever,,
3127,1,This machine was an exact replacement  for a coffee maker I had before that had quit.  I ordered this one AND a warranty.  When the coffee maker arrived the plastic bag it was in had a slit in its side.  The glass carafe slipped out and shattered on the floor.  Then  I noticed that the individual mug was missing.  Totally missing!  I tried emailing but my emails were undeliverable.  Then I called Hamilton Beach.  After waiting and waiting on the line I finally spoke with a lady.  She told me to email the copy of the receipt....but it HAD to be done before the 30 day cutoff.  I could not find the receipt  in my emails . Nothing more has been done.  I am using my old carafe and one serving mug...it works but I was still upset.  On top of that I HAVE NOT received my warranty. I saw my exact coffeemaker at Walmart yesterday for less than what I paid.  Lessons for the future. I was dissapointed.,1,2017-03-14,,,,Great coffeemaker....poor service,,
3128,1,"I purchased this coffee maker despite some of the negative reviews.  It has performed flawlessly now for about 3 weeks.  The one main difference I noticed right off the bat, was the temperature of the coffee. It actually is hot for a change.  I think this makes the coffee taste a whole lot better.  Maybe is just me, but I definitely recommend this coffee maker.",5,2018-02-05,,True,,MMMMmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!! HOT DELICOUS COFFEE!!!!!,,
3129,1,"The water reservoir has leaked since day 1.  For the first use, I set it up at night to brew coffee for the next morning.  When I woke up, there was no coffee because all the water had leaked out overnight, leaving a huge puddle of water all over the counter.  Thinking that maybe it was just a fluke, I brewed a pot immediately.  Though I was able to get a pot of coffee, there was still a leak occurring--it just didn't have enough time to leak the whole contents of the reservoir onto the counter, just a smaller puddle.  I continued to use the pot for about a week until I could go purchase another pot.  Each time the result was the same--a puddle of water under the coffeemaker.

3132,1,"Second one I've owned. First one lasted about 5 years, but what I hated about it was that the plate started rusting pretty early on and became really nasty by the end. I was happy when it just stopped warming so we could replace.<br /><br />Why buy it a second time? I looked at a couple hundred coffee pots on Amazon and this is the only one I found that has both the single cup and pot in one unit. I don't have space for a keurig and use the single cup side a lot. Overall thought it worked okay and it was $45 on Amazon vs the $90 I paid the first time.<br /><br />Trying to be very fastidious about drying off the burner of any coffee drips down there and not allowing any moisture on it!<br /><br />11/2017, UPDATE: DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP. Seriously: it didn't last quite a year before it just stopped working. As the holidays were just rolling around and I was getting ready to move, I didn't have time to deal with complaining to the manufacturer and trying to get a replacement as it was still in the 1 year warranty window.

3151,1,"I've had this coffee maker for about a month and I purchased it based on the majority of great reviews on amazon, so I wanted to add my own and also say that I love it and it's a great coffee maker! I am extremely happy with it and it was a great purchase. I actually didn't buy this through Amazon as they charge tax in NJ, and a very common store BBB that sends 20% coupons in the mail just about every week has this item for the same price, so I went there and picked it up saving 20%. So also after reading many other reviews I bought the HB Gold Tone Filter 80675 for $6 and the Krups 203-42 Grinder for $17 to use with the coffee maker and both have also been amazing. I have been grinding Starbucks beans as needed and have used the fresh ground beans in both the Carafe and Single Serve side and have been very very pleased with the strength and brew of the coffee. I find the coffee is brewed quickly and hot. I have never had an issue with the coffee not being hot enough that others have posted - but then again I don't know how people can go to Starbucks and ask for Extra Hot. I have not used the Senso Pod feature, and I doubt I ever will since the single side can use fresh ground coffee and I have not used the programmable feature yet so I can't comment on how they work.

3154,1,"We have had this coffee maker almost a year now and I am satisfied with it performance so far.<br />I set it up to brew the night before and it makes the one cup side first and then I turn the switch to make a big pot for my hubby when he gets up.  The travel cup provided keeps my coffee HOT!  I have to wait a bit for it to cool down.  I also love that it doesn't have a bunch of bells & whistles that go off when the coffee is done or when the pot goes off (it was so annoying w/my old coffee pot)<br /><br />The cons about this coffee maker are the way it shoots out steam when it's done (my old one also did this) and I have to keep it away from my cabinets as it steamed off the finish (wiped it down w/denatured alcohol & it looks good again).  The other con is that it never fills the pot with the same amount of water I fill it with- where does all that water go?  It is not in the place where I filled it!  It's a mystery to me.<br /><br />Anyway, when this one goes kaput, I will buy another one- that's how much I like it.

3202,1,I purchased this in haste after my old HB Flex brewer single serve side died after a few years. The first 3 days of this new one was great--strong tasty hot coffee. Then the 4th day--very weak coffee. Not sure what happened but it's brewing weak coffee on the single serve side every day now. I'm so upset because I'm back in the same boat as my old one and totally wasted my money on this. Plus I threw out the box (after testing and being happy with the result--why return??) so i can't even return this piece of junk. No more HB for me!!,1,2018-12-11,,True,,Single side brewing weak coffee in less than a week!,,

No, we did not buy an extended warranty and it craps out 2 months past its typical one year warranty.  Its pathetic when U.S. company appliances are designed and fabricated with inferior components and assembled in China (as usual).  Products should be robust enough to last more than just one year.  Until we bring manufacturing back to the US, I guess we will have to buy warranties on everything.  We called Hamilton Beach (1-800-851-8900) and they offered us 50% off their regular retail price, which brings the price down to what we paid for this product on Amazon in the first place.

My husband loves that he can set his thermos there with the timer and it will fill it up perfect with a great taste.

In the manual it says you can fill the reservoir up to 14 oz, we have not actually measured but it has no problem with the 2 different thermos' we use.

3283,1,"I love this coffee maker. I've had this for over 2 and half years and use it ever single day and have not had a single problem with it. It's super easy to use and maintain.<br /><br />I love the &#34;Bold&#34; brew setting. Adds a unique flavor to my coffee. It takes a little bit longer to brew on that setting but worth it. The timer function works fine and the clock keeps its time so you don't have to worry about it changing unless it gets unplugged.<br /><br />Cleaning is pretty easy. Just need some distilled white vinegar and you run it through the system and let it sit for 30 mins then rinse with a few cycles. You're supposed to do that once a month on each side. The filter baskets come out and can be hand washed. I hand wash the pot but I think its dish washer safe. The top opens up for easy access and can even be pulled apart and snapped back together. The mug it comes with is useless to me so I threw it away pretty quickly.<br /><br />The single serving side does not use K-Cups. I use a paper filter I fold the right way to act like your typical drip coffee maker. I love the auto stop when removing the pot to pour a cup while the coffee is still brewing. This works by a spring and a gasket that closes when you remove the pot and opens when the pot is in place. I did however forget to put the top of the pot back on after cleaning once so this gasket was closed while it was brewing and it over flowed and grinds got everywhere. This was a pain to clean but I haven't done it again.<br /><br />I'm very clumsy and have hit the pot against things and dropped it with out any cracks or chips so it's built well.<br /><br />There are a few negatives but nothing that ruins the coffee maker for me, but for the review I'll go over them.<br />-The power cord is a little short. I think it's about 3 feet long so if you don't have an outlet near where you will put the coffee maker you'll need an extension cord.<br />-The mug is useless. It can easily spill and doesn't keep the coffee hot for much longer than a regular ceramic mug.<br />-You can't use the single serve and the pot side at the same time. Switching from one side to the other turns off the other side.<br />-The coffee pot is glass with a plastic brim. Fluid gets caught up on this brim so you'll never get the last little bit of coffee.<br />-The reusable filter on the single serving side wasn't very good. Too many grinds got through and would give a funky taste. I instead would use a regular paper filter folded the right way.<br />-If you are going to use a regular mug in the single serving side it splashes quite a bit. To prevent that, the base comes apart and you can stack up the pieces to raise the cup closer to the drip so there is less splash and less space for it to escape the cup. Depending on the mug it can become a scary balancing act. I try to use a tall mug instead of the balancing act when I can.<br /><br />These little issues are worth it for the quality of the cup of coffee the machine brews. I would buy again whenever this finally gives out on me.",5,2016-10-19,2.0,True,,"Great tasting coffee and a great feature to brew single or multiple cups at once.

3291,1,"I wanted to love this machine, but it's more like tolerance or moderate-like.  It's a drip-coffee maker so you get what you expect to get-  average tasting coffee in average time for average cost.  I have been using it for three months as a mostly-weekends machine since I decided I just don't have time to keep pressing coffee.  I had a Cuisanart machine prior that was a piece of junk so based on reviews, I was looking forward to going with a less-label-conscious decision.<br /><br />The good--<br />- Brews fairly quickly<br />- Looks nice<br />- Simple controls and all features work- timer, timed shut-off, and brewing strength (somewhat-  works best with partial pots)<br />- Price-  despite the frustrations and limitations, it still seems like a good value<br />- Decent coffee-  like all drip machines (did not notice the odd, plastic taste from the carafe or single-serve that some reviewers commented on)<br />- Pot stays hot-  coffee stays fairly hot while plate is hot and maintains typical temp for a glass pot.<br /><br />The not so good--<br />- Difficult to fill the main reservior due to the small water inlet.  NOTE-  It has a nice compact design for a &#34;side-by-side&#34; so I understand that there has to be some compromise, but it's pretty darn small!  The filling problem is exacerbated by the pot.  If you don't take your time, this pot, like so many others, lets the water &#34;lace&#34; over the pouring &#34;notch&#34; and spills everywhere.  From my experience, it seems like Black and Decker is the only one who has engineered a better pouring shape; shame that their electronics don't follow suit.<br />- Lid does not come off of pot making it exceedingly difficult to clean AND making for what I predict is premature breakage due to having to shove a hand/cleaning item into the pot with the flip lid swinging around.<br /><br />********UPDATE, June 29, 2016--  Still kicking!

But after just regularly daily use, our pot stopped brewing in the middle of a pot last week. It's only been 8 months, and while I'm under warranty (I've contacted Hamilton Beach--we'll see how that goes), I'm pretty alarmed at what this may be telling me about the quality of the product. Surely there's a decent brewer with a lifespan longer than 6--12 months! I seriously might have to buy a Mr. Coffee...the only coffee brewing pots I've always donated away before they've died.

3372,1,"Just purchased this and had our first full use of it yesterday.  So far, this thing is wonderful... I will update this review if it goes downhill from here.  I love the fact that we can use the carafe for the weekends when we're both home and in need of coffee, or use the single serve option for the mornings since we both head out to work at different times.  We went from the Keurig to this, and can honestly say this has been less maintenance so far.  Also, the coffee is stronger!  The filtered basket this comes with is bigger more simple than Keurig's filter that you put your own coffee in (not that it was complicated, but cleaning that thing every single day got annoying) and makes it that much easier to use.  It also takes Senseo pods, so there are technically 3 ways of getting your coffee from this machine.  (Also, you can make your own Senseo pods with little filters sold separately on Amazon, which makes that option a little more attractive.)<br /><br />UPDATE: I finally found the one flaw in this coffee maker - the single serving side tends to splash the coffee out of the mugs a little.  However, I have been using this exclusively since the day I purchased it and still love it, despite the little flaw.  I cannot believe how many people are buying Keurigs when this thing is a hundred times better!  If you're debating on a Keurig or this, do yourself a favor and get this one!  No pricey k-cups, and I've been using my own coffee right into the filter and it's been working perfectly.  In fact, my coffee (the same stuff I used in my Keurig) tastes so much better!  Also, we sometimes drink tea - this thing is perfect for a quick cup of hot water for tea.  Should there be any issues down the road, I will make sure to update again.  But in the meantime, I probably would have purchased this thing for a more expensive price knowing how great it works!",5,2015-11-09,4.0,True,,this thing is wonderful..,,

I don't like that because I don't drink it as quickly as it thinks I should and it is cold when I go back for a refill. Also, the coffee mug that comes with it has plastic on the inside. I don't like to drink from plastic because the drink usually tastes like plastic. Other than that, its beautiful and makes a great cup of coffee!",4,2014-02-24,,True,,Coffee Lover,,

On the weekend, I tend to drink more so I use the full pot...and when I have company. I've had no problems so far. I gave it 4 stars due the speed of the big pot, takes a little longer than I'd like...but no biggie. Also, it was $30 more at Walmart so thanks Amazon! I would buy it again.",4,2015-02-03,,True,,Love it,,
3394,1,We've mostly been utilizing the single serve option as we purchased it after our Keurig died and it is AWESOME! No waste from the single serve cups you use with other single serve options and we're saving a ton by purchasing regular ground coffee or beans we freshly grind ourselves. We can adjust the measurements to our own taste or cup size we prefer. Highly recommend this product.,5,2016-05-22,,True,,Highly recommend,,
3395,1,"I love that it has both a single serve and the carafe option.  When an entire pot is brewed it seems like the coffee gets cold rather quickly.  Im not sure if its the temperature of the coffee when being brewed or if the carafe does not keep the coffee warm, but either way, the coffee is lukewarm as soon as it is done brewing.<br />When I make the single serve I do not have the same problem- I do wish the coffee was a little warmer, but I like my coffee piping hot!<br />There is no temperature setting on the machine.",3,2017-04-16,19.0,True,,lukewarm coffee,,
3396,1,"Have had this for about a month and it works great. I love the single serve side bc sometimes I like a flavored coffee. Only drawback is I can’t find the pods at my local Target or Kroger, but it works well with regular coffee so not that big of a deal.",5,2018-01-14,,True,,Good buy,,
3397,1,"So many of the pots with single servers do not come with a cup. I love that this one did. It works well and the light display when &#34;on&#34; is a nice blue and not the ugly orange/yellow color. One thing to note: when making a single serving coffee, you might want to use less grounds than you normally would. My first few tries were way to strong. The pot was lovely. Oh, and with the single side, you get a little filter cup so no worries there. So glad I got this one. I was searching for weeks trying to decide.",5,2013-12-19,,True,,Love it. Glad I found it.,,
3398,1,"I bought this for my husband who is an avid coffee drinker. He uses it everyday and seems to really like it. He loves the programmable timer. The only thing we aren't crazy about is how messy it is to clean the coffee filter for the single serve.

3400,1,This is an awesome coffee pot! So glad I went with this instead of another brewstation. Makes and keeps coffee hot! The travel cup side is so handy and doesn't require &#34;special cups&#34; to brew. Best coffee pot we have purchased.,5,2017-01-03,,True,,Love it!,,
3401,1,The part that I dislike is the section where you pour the water is very small.,4,2018-10-17,,True,,Makes good coffee,,
3402,1,"This coffee pot does everything I could have asked for. Couple of the highlights I think:<br /><br />The side single serve dispenser was something I never had before. Doesn't use K-Cups (says it can use a Senseo? pod, but haven't seen any around) but has a reusable filter that you can use your own grounds in. Great if you don't want to do a full pot for late night cravings. Takes a couple of minutes to brew once you start it, and easy to clean.<br /><br />Easy to use. One switch turns it from single to full pot and one button to brew. Easy to set up clock and timer settings for auto-brew. It has an auto-hold feature for if you want to pour coffee while it's brewing, and so far hasn't leaked at all when I've used it.<br /><br />I noticed a couple of reviews talk about a weird taste from when they used this. I haven't had that. That said, it seems like they're not making this model any more (the newer model lets you brew K-cups on the single serve side) so it's possible they had some return/refurbished units that didn't get cleaned well or something. But again, I haven't had any issues with taste or really any issues at all.<br /><br />The only two cons I could think of (and not enough for me to even ding a star off it) is that they're not making it anymore so don't know how much support you'll get with it for replacements, etc. Also, the main water fill area for the full pot is kind of narrow so I can see some people having issues filling that. I've been good and haven't spilled and doesn't bother me, but thought enough about it to say something.<br /><br />Also, using it with a reusable main filter (forgot the brand, bought it with my Black Friday coffee pot I got last year that kicked it after 11 months) and pretty happy with that. Would recommend finding one of those if you're tired of having to remember to buy filters every once in awhile.",5,2016-12-03,2.0,True,,Very happy with this purchase!,,
3403,1,I have had this for several months and it works great.  Very easy to use and love the fact that I have a choice to make a single cup if needed.,5,2018-01-25,,True,,Works Great,,
3404,1,"I got tired of the k-cup prices and bought this one. We love it! We can make a single travel size, regular size cup, or a pot. I like the fact that I can use my own coffee and it is cheaper. So..I am glad that I made this purchase.",5,2017-03-23,,True,,We love it! We can make a single travel size,,
3405,1,"We had two different methods to make coffee, an espresso machine for espresso, Lattes, cappuccino w lots of foam, hot chocolate, and cold pour over coffees to include frapaccinios. Then we also use s huge French press that makes three coffees at a time.  We needed something for larger groups of visitors with a twelve cup carrafe and that's why we purchased this machine.  My typical pet peeves regarding coffee machines are largely met with this machine, it brews really good and hot coffee, it will do a bolder stronger carafe or single serve, plus it brews a really great pot or single cup of hot tea! All in all a good machine at an ok price that I don't consider a screaming deal but fairly reasonable. They need to step upbtheir game though and I nclude a high carafe single cup, they need to include some coffee pods to let you try out that option as well. It uses paper filters for carafe with the capability to go to a lifetime basket filter eliminating the need to purchase and us paper filters each time.  The machine's single serve side does come with a permanent filter. Machine should also be offered in a dual voltage model, different heat settings to insurevtge children's hot cocoa doesn't come out too hot. The build up for using a coffee cup versus taller single serving carafe looks shaky. Over all not bad, if price was a bit more reasonable and all mentioned extra features were included, this would be a five star easily.",3,2016-12-28,2.0,True,,it brews really good and hot coffee,,
3406,1,I love this coffee pot. If my husband is off work or if we have company we make a whole pot but usually it's just me at home and I don't drink a lot of coffee. So it's perfect. I can make myself 1 small or large cup and not have to waste any. It looks great too.,5,2016-09-03,,True,,Perfect,,
3407,1,"I purchased this through Amazon and have had it for a little over a week so can not say how it lasts. My wife drinks more coffee than me and drinks it much weaker. This required us to have two regular pots going in the morning, but mine was setup to brew less than half the carafe. They took up counter space and wasted coffee. This HB is perfect for us because she can brew hers and I can brew mine. Using a travel mug is just right for me. If once in a while, I want more, I can redo the travel mug side. Let me clarify, we cannot brew both sides at the same time, but it's no big deal. When one side is done, simply flip the switch and push the start button. Here's something to remember: The server will shut off the carafe side while the travel mug side is brewing and vice versa. The mug side takes so little time, it will not affect the temperature of the carafe. If you do the mug side, you must switch it back to the carafe side to keep that coffee warm. To the best of my knowledge, the mug side does not heat. It is not noisy, no bad tastes from the pot itself, and it does what it is supposed to do. The only drawback is that it does not give an audible signal when the carafe side is finished brewing. We are happy with it so far and glad we purchased it.",5,2016-12-20,3.0,True,,Works well for us!,,

3435,1,"GREAT!!!  Cleaning with the vinegar was easy. Made a carafe of coffee this morning - 6 cups. That's enough to fill my mugs a couple of times. The coffee was hot and no plastic taste. I'm trying a blond roast and ground coffee on med-fine - as recommended. Easy to fill with water and on the carafe side, has a side view letting you know how much water you have placed in the machine. Footprint about the same as a George Forman Grill. The unit is 13 1/2 inches high and fits easily on the counter under the cupboard.  Carafe does not dribble and is programmable for both single and carafe side.<br /><br />A couple of downsides, but not close to a deal breaker. Cord in 24 inches, so it may limit location on the counter. The coffee on the carafe side is top loaded requiring the lid to be opened needing a clearance of 22 inches. This requires me to pull the coffeemaker out from the wall and from under the cupboard to load - not difficult.<br /><br />I would recommend this unit for anyone that sees the convenience of a two in one coffee maker.",5,2014-05-22,7.0,True,,GREAT,,

3450,1,It’s as expected.  A little big and bulky and I thought there was a water reservoir but you have to put water in each time you brew.  I don’t really like the single serve side.

3451,1,"Love the versatility.  My wife uses it as single cup during the week, and on weekends we brew an entire pot.

3452,1,"Good buy. Works well so far.<br />My only complaint is that there is no warming element on the single- serve side. And since that brews 1 cup, pretty quickly, that doesn't allow much time for the water to heat up. It comes out hot, but that heat dissipates quickly with the absence of a warming element. So if I don't finish drinking my cup within 5 mins or so, I have to microwave it.<br />Minor inconvenience. It may stay warmer longer if you brew into an insulated mug.

3501,1,Good product.... While it worked. I originally bought it because I like the idea that I can make a single cup without using pods. The auto feature worked excellently for having a hot cup OR pot of coffee in the morning. 2 stars off becuase the pump on the pot side of the machine became really slow after about 1 year of use (and we used filtered Brita water to brew coffee).

3510,1,"This does not take K-Cups, but I like that. It takes coffee pods (Senseo seems to make most of what's available) they are cheaper and create less plastic waste. You can also buy empty pods and fill them with your own grounds. If you want stronger coffee there is room for two pods. Or it comes with everything to brew single cups with grounds, all of these options are cheaper than K-cups. The timer also works with the single brew so you can wake up to just one warm to-go cup or a whole pot. The drip pan has a built stacking system that allows you to use cups up to 8 1/2&#34; tall down to 4&#34; with no splashing. It takes a little less than three minutes for a full large cup and about twelve for a pot so it's not really fast, but it hasn't bothered me. It does NOT come with the commuter cup in the picture/the other model with the k-cup compatibility does so don't get that mixed up. If you like the K cups system this may not be for you, if you want a descent coffee pot and a single brew system this will save you counter space and take good care of you.",5,2015-03-19,,True,,Makes great coffee has good features,,

3559,1,I'm glad I bought this and not its older brother which is $20 more and has issues. It brews great coffee like my previous coffee maker and the single cup option is a smart and useful design feature. However I've tried a couple of single coffee packets and they don't work that well. Water seems to flow around them somehow and it makes weak coffee. So I put my fresh ground coffee in the provided filter and it can make a pretty pretty potent 12-14 ounces of coffee. Sometimes I put a 12 oz cup with cream in it and my espresso blend in the single filter and get pretty close to a nice double shot latte . I'm not a foamy latte guy like the distorted product Starbucks sells. I like to drink coffee not air. I've been using it for a month or so now and have people over every weekend and drop by just for coffee. I fine grind my coffee and use one standard scooper for every 3 cups of water and this works whether your making half a pot or a full one. Time will tell but so far I'm pretty pleased with this one,5,2014-06-15,,True,,Best for the money,,

So consequently, my first single serve cup of decaf was underwhelming and had sludge in the bottom. But it didn't overlfow so I got brave with the second try, bought some little single serve filters and used more grounds. The coffee was better, but I still had sludge in the bottom of the cup. I'm just thinking for nearly 60 bucks, this kind of mickey mouse stuff should be engineered out. The 3 bucks I spent for tiny filters, apparently, was a waste also, since I still have sludge.

3659,1,This is a mediocre appliance at Best.  IT DOES NOT HAVE A PAUSE AND SERVE FEATURE!  What coffee maker in this day and age would not have a &#34;Pause and Serve&#34; feature?  This item retails at a regular price of $79.  Approximately 2 weeks ago I turned on my Kindle Fire device and a special offer for this appliance was offered for $20.  The offer was to run until 7:00 p.m.  I attempted to place an order from my Kindle at approximately 6:30 p.m. and was not able to make the purchase.  No explanation was offered and two Amazon Reps were not able to tell me why.  I realized later that they had a limit  and evidently the limit had been reached.<br /><br />I watched the appliance for days after to see if the price would come down again.  I finally made a purchase for $59. and agreed to join Amazon Prime to get free shipping.  It is a good looking product but I would not consider it a &#34;high quality&#34; product.  It takes awhile to figure out the right quantity of coffee grounds to use for your particular taste.  The formula indicated in the product manual does not even come close to being correct.  The carafe and single serve feature is convenient and was a primary motivator for my purchase.  I do not want to hassle with returning the product so I will keep it.

3698,1,"We have had this coffee pot for less than a year. It's a great looking machine and I don't mind it being on my counter. In theory, it's also great for those times when you need a single cup vs. a pot. We found right away that the cup side was not for us. Perhaps it is the coffee we use (Costco brand) or the fact that it's a mesh filter, our coffee had a very dark later at the bottom of our cup and it really did taste dirty. Maybe there are paper filters for single cup, but we stopped using it altogether.<br /><br />The pot portion was just fine, as well, however, we had to clean this with vinegar more frequently than any pot I've ever had simply to get it to make a full pot within the two hours that the warmer stayed on. In fact, currently, we program it to start brewing at 4:30am so that when I get up at 5:30 am, I can have a cup of coffee. (It's at between 4-6 cups at that point.) NOBODY has time for that. It is also leaving two cups in the holding tank which won't come out.<br /><br />It's terrible and our new Bunn is coming tomorrow.

3700,1,"I love this thing. I bought this one to replace my little coffee maker I bought to use for guests in their room. My other large coffee maker broke so I had been using my little coffee maker and trying hard to get my pour over strainer to work. It's terrible. I gave up and did some research on coffee makers and found this one.<br />What I like are the two options to brew up to 12 cups of coffee AND brew single serve. I had an option to buy a maker that's nearly the exact copy as this one but uses K cups with no option of using loose coffee and decided I'd rather get this one so I can use my premium coffee as an option. Should I want K cups, I'll cut open the cup and pour the coffee into the reusable coffee strainer. This maker also gives you an option to use a tumbler OR coffee cup. Simply fill your cup with water and pour into it. Simple. Same for the carafe.  I like that there's an LED light for the clock but it doesn't stay on. It turns off when the coffee is done. The coffee brews FAST. I'm used to makers taking some time to brew, even with new makers. This one brews so fast that I hardly had time to tend to the kids before it was done. The pot stays hot too. Sometimes you want a quick cup before it's done. Too bad though. You have to wait. I’m not sure someone rushing to work would mind though if they’ve scheduled their single cup to be done right before leaving.<br />The colors are nice on this machine too. Since stainless steel + black is still popular, it should match well. This is also not a huge machine. It's actually smaller than my single Mr. Coffee machine and shorter as well. Looks like a mini espresso machine. What I wish I could do though is not have to pull the machine out from under a cabinet to pour in the water. If there was a drawer instead, it would make it easy for many of this. This is just a personal wish though.<br />Pros: LED Light, single and carafe coffee brewing, reusable coffee strainer for the single cup, fast brewing, heating pad for carafe, stainless steel + black, not too big, pocket to hide extra wire within itself, programmable brewing for auto brew, ability to use tumbler or coffee cup with stand, given instructions on how to clean it and suggests vinegar once a week for hard water (Use Lemon Shine instead if your machine stops working by making a solution of water and the crystals and brew)<br /><br />Cons: No option to keep LED clock light on, you have to wait until all the coffee has been brewed into the carafe before pouring, My buttons were a little lopsided (probably from packaging),",5,2018-06-19,26.0,True,,Great! Two great options in one!,,
3701,1,We have been using this daily for two months and I like this- hubby likes to brew a full pot and then store it for drinking over the next two days- I hate the taste of old coffee and thought my only hope was an expensive Keurig and then found this little dream machine that does both.  Like that I can use my regular coffee on the single brew side- very intuitive to work- still have not really needed to use the manual but will need to for the cleaning that is due.  Can make a single serve big cup (cup not included with mine) or a regular coffee mug size with the metal filter that has suggested amounts in bumps of the side of the filter.  Has a nifty series of stacking rings to raise the cup to the correct height- not electronic just stack em and go.  Take up about the same room our old coffee maker used to take- important in my small kitchen.  All in all please with the purchase and hope it works for a long time.,5,2017-06-19,34.0,True,,Happy find- I get single brew happiness and hubby can have his big pot of coffee.,,
3702,1,"So far so good! I received the coffee maker a few days ago and set it up in less than 5 minutes. It even came with a few paper filters for the carafe side so you don’t have to worry about having them on hand to start out. I brewed a full 12 cup carafe right away and it worked just as it said it would. No plastic taste to the coffee like other reviews have said. I programmed it so that it will brew a pot in the morning and that worked perfectly! I love waking up to fresh coffee and have the house smelling like a coffee shop! It is super easy to clean. The single serve filter and the carafe filter container as well as the carafe are all dishwasher safe, however I will probably wash them by hand just to be safe, I’ve read a lot of reviews about fragile carafes. With that said, my glass carafe was not damaged at all when it arrived. Amazon did a great job of packaging the product and I even received it in less time than I was supposed to. I ordered it around 3pm and received it the next day by 11am without paying for one day shipping! Gotta love Amazon! Lastly, the 2 hr automatic shut off is a wonder. I can leave the coffee on the warming plate without having to worry that I will forget to turn it off later. Overall this is a great coffee maker, I just hope it stands the test of time! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a coffee maker with single serve capabilities!",5,2016-11-09,28.0,True,,So far so good!,,
3703,1,"This is by far the worst coffee maker we have ever purchased. After a month, the coffee still has a plastic taste. The manufacturer has recommendations on running through vinegar to remove the taste, so it's obviously an ongoing problem. It didn't work. Why not solve the problem before the consumer gets the product instead of them having to deal with it. Also, it brews single serve cups painfully slowly. We bought a Keurig and went back to that. Never a funny after taste, even right out of the box.",1,2018-05-15,14.0,True,,Slow brewing and tastes like plastic,,

I loved this coffee maker, but I guess I expect a product to last longer than 7 stinking months. Not impressed. I'll update this review if I have any luck getting Hamilton Beach to stand by their product and replace it. If you're not seeing an update, they didn't care that they make products that can't even make it through the first year of normal use.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/30/2018: I did contact Hamilton Beach and based on previous reviewers I was very concerned they would make me pay money to return the broken coffee maker. I was pleasantly surprised that they opted to allow me to remove the cord as they described to make it safe for disposal and I just received the replacement maker today. I'm still a little concerned it might not last like I hope, but hoping all the negative reviews has prompted them to improve. I'll update this review if it ends up lasting or if it dies again like the first one.

I make her coffee every morning in the single serve side and she loves it and I get to do something nice (she does so much for me).

3711,1,"I do not normally review products but on this occasion I am so incensed at the poor customer service from Hamilton Beach. Bought this coffee maker as a gift for my husband's birthday in Nov '16 having read lots of reviews on Amazon. I was swayed by all the positive comments about the quality and taste of the brewed coffee. I read 2 negative reviews about the hot plate staining/burning so purchased the additional protection plan. Have used the coffee maker for 2 months. It DOES make great tasting coffee, single serve and carafe, BUT the hot plate has already stained and burned and the paint has started to peel with only 2 months of use. Prior to this coffee maker we owned a different Hamilton Beach coffee maker and replaced it after nearly 8 years of use because of a peeling hot plate, which was to be expected after all that use. I am super fussy about wiping the hot plate after use and once the coffee has brewed I turn the coffee maker off and remove the carafe. For the hot plate to stain after such a short time is unacceptable. First contacted Amazon who advised that for the first 12 months the product was covered by manufacturer's warranty not protection plan, so in reality the 4 yr plan only actually covers product for an additional 3 years, not 4. Contacted Hamilton Beach. Customer Service wait times terrible. They agreed to replace product if and when they had any in stock but would charge $12 shipping and postage! Went back to Amazon and requested replacement as product still within time frame for returns. Yay! Amazon. They will replace coffee maker free of charge and I can return  defective product with free drop off at UPS. My advice, don't waste your time on Hamilton Beach and don't waste your money on additional protection plans.<br />Bottom line, Hamilton Beach have made a great looking coffee maker that brews great coffee but have dropped the ball when it comes to a quality heat resistant finish on the hot plate.

3741,1,"Update: After owning this for a couple years, we have definitely gotten a lot of use out of this machine. It's incredibly convenient. I'm sure we've got our money's worth. The best part is that we do not have to buy Keurig cups, we just use regular ground coffee. The only thing at this point to know is this: it leaks. A lot. We bought a microwave glass plate, round, from the thrift store to keep the counter safe. You can barely see it now, but we have to drain off the water. It's a lot. We'll keep using this til it drops, but we may look somewhere else when we need to replace it, because it's too messy, and other companies are making the same thing.<br /><br />My wife loves this. We could have gotten by with another hot pot to heat water for our tea habits. But this made her very happy. It's as convenient as a Keurig, but we just throw the tea bags in our actual cup, it works fine. The only negative of the single use side, is that you have to wait 1-2 minutes or so to brew another cup, or it will steam up in a poof and make a finishing sound if you pour in water immediately after brewing. We use the carafe for making bulk hot cocoa (we have 5 children) or tea, or for steeping tea right in the carafe to make a gallon of sweetened, cold tea. It's easy, with the shape of the top of the carafe. So, for us, it's a Keurig and iced tea maker in one.

3778,1,"I had one of these that served me well for perhaps three years. The biggest problem is that after a month or two, the coffee maker would take 1/2 hour or more to make a small pot(6-8 cups). I learned that I had to add a cup of vinegar to the reservoir and let sit for an hour or so to break up mineral deposits, even though I'm using filtered water. Hmmph! Once that was done I would run the vinegar through the system and a couple clean pots of water to remove the vinegar residue. This seemed to work fine, even though it was a pain in the neck, until yesterday. For some reason, the vinegar ran straight out of the bottom of the coffee maker, all over the counter top and floors. What a mess and the house REEKS of vinegar. I cleaned everything up thinking it must have been some sort of &#34;pilot error&#34; on my part. I tried it again and ANOTHER MESS. ARGH! I'm guessing there was a rubber seal or something on the bottom of the pot that was eventually eroded by the vinegar. I ended up having to throw the coffee maker away. RIP.

3899,1,"My old coffee maker finally bit the dust. When I was searching I wanted one with a few extra features and this one seemed to fit the bill. After about 6 months of use, I am very happy with this purchase!<br /><br />MOST USEFUL FEATURES<br />- Duel brew. It's really convenient to be able to brew just a single cup of coffee when needed. And it's just a flip of the switch to do it!<br />- Auto Brew. This is pretty standard, but still worth noting. When getting up earlier than normal it's nice to be able to set it up the night before.<br />- Mesh basket for single serve side. I wish this was also included for the carafe side.<br /><br />AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT<br />- Bold Brew Setting. I like my coffee bold, I always add a few extra grounds. So I thought I'd love this setting, but it's way too much! It made my coffee taste terrible.<br />- The carafe brew tastes better then the single serve brew. My wife and I both agree. Not sure why this is, but when we brew a pot, or even 1/2 a pot, it just tastes a little better than using the single serve side.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great coffee maker! Very well built and it looks great!",5,2018-08-01,,True,,Great Coffee Maker!,,
3900,1,I’ve had no problems with this coffeemaker I always thought it was a pretty decent one because you could make one cup or multiple cupsin the carafe however I haven’t had it for a year and today when I was filling up the carafe it was almost full and I was almost ready to walk away from the sink to pour it into the coffee maker and the bottom of it just fell out of it ..(below the silver ring ).....just separated from the rest of the pot !<br /> I have it in one big piece but had I walked away from the sink it would be in shards all over my kitchen floor I’m thinking it’s faulty glass ?<br />If it had been a full brewed steaming pot I can only imagine what could’ve happened!<br />Maybe it’s just a fluke but Im going to shy away from this brand in case there’s a bunch of carafes out there that are manufactured wrong!,2,2018-01-05,,True,,Dangerous pot separation!,,
3901,1,"I Had some initial issues with delivery but once received I have been very happy with this coffee maker. Brews well and I like the bold brew setting. I have not yet tried the single brew feature as I was under the impression from YouTtube reviews that the coffee maker shipped with a free travel mug. Hamilton Beach has paid attention to small details such as an adapter for the single cup brew that allows you to use the K-Cups. This should please those of us that like the Keurig style feature without a Keurig style price tag, combine this with the single serve drip tray that adjusts as a riser to allow you to use smaller cups and you have great value for money.<br /><br />The unit also looks attractive on the counter while occupying just the right amount of space.  The price cannot be beaten and for Prime members, you can also enjoy the 2 days free shipping.<br /><br />Britech Score out of 5 :<br /><br />Looks - 5<br />Function - 5<br />Ease of use - 5<br />Shipping - 3<br /><br />Total 18/20",5,2017-09-10,,True,,Great value for a feature packed budget priced coffee maker,,
3902,1,"With this coffee maker, you have various options for brewing coffee from a single travel mug to a full pot and everything in between!<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />1. You can brew a whole pot of your go-to coffee, (Colombian for me), and, you can brew a large travel mug of say french roast or decaf on the single serve side for a friend, co-worker, or partner etc.<br /><br />2. The permanent filter basket on the single serve side is great for freshly ground coffee or coffee pods etc. If you want to make tea, hot chocolate, or, say oatmeal in a mug, you can use the single serve side to act as a hot water dispenser.<br /><br />3. Cleanup was pretty easy. Just wash everything with soap and hot water or rinse it off and put it in the dishwasher. (And be sure to de scale once a month.)<br /><br />4. The brew strength selector really does make a difference which is nice!<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />1. No permanent filter included for the pot side of the coffee maker. (It's not a big deal but still...)<br /><br />2. No insert to deal with Keurig single serve coffee pods on the single serve side. This would have been nice but is not a deal breaker for me as I don't make a habit of buying them. (I understand this has been addressed in the new version of this machine that came out recently?)<br /><br />3. I'm not a big fan of the glass carafe as a general rule... Accidents can happen;especially with a toddler around! I wish this model was available with a stainless steel thermal carafe as an alternative! They don't shatter, they don't crack due to temperature shock, and, you can put a thermal carafe in the fridge overnight for iced coffee!<br /><br /> If you want a versatile coffee maker that allows you to brew a whole pot for guests, or, a mug or two, go for this machine!",5,2016-10-02,,True,,Versatile!,,
3903,1,"I went through THREE coffee makers that used the K-cups and decided to try this model.  For the sake of the environment alone it ought to be a best seller.  The pods are soft fabric and will quickly decompose while those plastic capsules continue to add to our landfills.  There are a number of coffee pods available through Amazon but the grocery stores just haven't gotten the message.  I've only use the single serve side for nearly 2 years now making on average 4 cups a day.  The coffee is only as good as the brew you run through the machine - unless you want to invest in a professional outfit for a thousand or more.  I'm not into those flavored coffees - you either like COFFEE or those flavored kiddie drinks.  This machine produces an acceptable cup of coffee in a short time. This past year the fine mesh filter grew a bit clogged and tried cleaning it.  It didn't clean well so started using the machine without the filter. Previously, the filter held a bit of water after making a cup of coffee, leaving annoying dribbles after the cup was removed. The pods themselves act as a filter so the unit works fine without and there has been no further problem with the after cup dribbles.",5,2017-02-11,,True,,A machine and product friendly to the environment.,,
3904,1,"This is a coffee maker.  No great shakes there, but it does have some clever features, especially the one-cup brewer on the side.  And of course all the requisite electronics for programming, etc.  What I like about the electronics is that it doesn't beep at me when it's done brewing, it just silently finishes the task, and very quickly at that.<br /><br />NOW, here's what I find totally genius about this unit, and you may find it odd.  This is the FIRST coffee pot EVER that I have owned where the carafe DOES NOT leak and dribble all over the place.  Seriously, somebody did some focused research on the surface tension of water and coffee and developed a pour spout that does not make a mess - EVER!<br /><br />So, there's an unheralded engineer somewhere deep in the bowels of Hamilton-Beach that deserves a huge raise for making this carafe leak and dribble proof.  THANK YOU for the little things.",5,2018-10-09,,True,,It's the little things,,
3905,1,"I've used this for about a week now.  Buying a new coffee maker based on reviews was difficult as everybody has something bad to say about every model, including this one.  So far, I've primarily used the carafe side, but tested out the single serve side twice.  Both work absolutely fine.  No leaks with this one like I had with my Mr. Coffee model that finally died.  Apparently this is something that I saw on many coffee maker reviews, so I'm glad it's not happening with this one (so far).  About the only &#34;con&#34; I can see to this one is that for whatever reason, it doesn't maintain the last brew setting you selected.  I prefer it &#34;bold&#34; and I have to set it every time - whether I'm brewing it manually, or using the program to brew it automatically in the morning.  Why they chose to force us to set the brew setting (if we want it strong) each time is beyond me.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this coffee maker, so far.",5,2017-08-04,,True,,"So far, it seems like a good coffee maker",,

We decided to go back to something more basic and this coffee maker does the job so well! I love the look and feel and how easy and sleek it is. Programming is so simple and I love the added bonus of the single cup. It does not come with a cup for the single cup, but I found a perfect one for under 10$. My husband really likes the single serving for the mornings when he is in a hurry and only wants a cup to take with him.

I was skeptical since I have never owned a Hamilton Beach product.  The coffee tastes pretty good but I am not an expert and I use a fair amount of flavored creamer. The timer works great. I have only used the single cup side a couple of times but it is really a smart design.  I will probably use it more in the future when my husband and I start different work hours. It looks very sleek and matches my other appliances perfectly.  My daughter tried to find the same model in Wal-Mart but all they had was the regular carafe on one side and the single cup side was for a pod type coffee.

3929,1,"So far so good. Both sides make a good cup of hot coffee so it does its job. No indication of bad tastes or smells but I did wash it well and run a couple of batches of water through both sides before adding coffee and trying it. The carafe is no-drip and the coffee maker looks nice. This unit replaces a Hamilton Beach brew station that is a little finicky about dispensing coffee into a cup and a cheap single brew that has seen better days--and I have been heating a cup in the microwave to get it hot enough for a while.  If I choose to use K-cups I will just dump the grounds into the single brew basket--that will probably work better anyway. This is not a fast brewer on either side (not ridiculous but not speedy), but I can program either side so that my coffee is waiting when I get up. The single side allows for a variety of mug sizes.

I don't know why they wouldn't include it on the large side if they had it for the single side.<br /><br />Simple to use, even the strong brew that they warn will take longer finishes quickly.<br /><br />What I didn't like - the carafe.  They have it so that it actually vents steam up around your hand when pouring if you're like me and hold it towards the top of the handle.  Stupid design in my opinion, I don't want that heat scalding my fingers when I pour the way I've always poured on any other coffee maker in the past.  The other annoyance - the carafe has a lip on the inside so it's difficult to get all the water poured out simply by pouring it out - you end up having to tip it back and forth a few times to force the water up and over that lip into the reservoir.<br /><br />But since my complaints center around the carafe, not the whole unit, I'd say that if it had any other carafe I would've given this 5 stars.

The carafe side brews fast and hot and stays hot for a long while and will turn off automatically after a few hours. I love the single serve size when I just want one quick cup of coffee in the afternoon or evening. The pods you need have to be specific type which was the only bummer but to me it wasn’t a big deal- just using regular coffee is cheaper anyway and not any harder.

After my old coffee maker died, I thought I would like a Krups...but after getting one and using it a few days, I didn't like it.  Seems like all I was doing was throwing away the K cups.  So I took it back and went back online to review other types of makers.  I ran across this which makes a full pot or you can make just one cup using your own coffee (no buying K cups and throwing them away)..  The best of both worlds.

The sides have separate reservoirs and heaters, for single cup you just fill the cup you want with water, dump it in. The pot side omg has a translucent side on the reservoir, you can pour water in right from a jug to the desired number of cups. The pot pours so clean, no dribbling all over the counter. Also, on the single side, the cup doesnt need to be riight up against where the coffe comes out, it streams nicely no splatters if there is a 3-4 inch gap. NOT a k-cup holder. You can use the included little washable filter, or take small size basket filters and trim off 3/4 of an inch, plop one in the basket. 2 round scoops for a 16 oz thermos cup, 2 flat scoops for regular mug. You can heat water for a cuppa tea as well. So far we have only used the pot side for 2 mug batches which is the 6 cup mark, tastes great.",5,2017-07-06,,True,,The best coffee pot ever.,,

I even tried brewing 2 Senseo pods for a single serving and the coffee still didn't taste right and it was an 8 oz. serving of coffee.<br /><br />If you are looking for a single serve coffee maker spend the money and get a Keurig. K Cup coffee is delicious and you can decide how bold you want it.<br /><br />I love the coffee carafe. I make a large pot of coffee and keep it in the fridge. In retrospect I wish I would have bought the standard coffee carafe brewer and not wasted money on Senseo pods.",3,2018-04-26,,True,,"Coffee carafe is great, Senseo pod coffee is watery and weak",,

4030,1,"What a great coffee maker, especially for the price. Coffee is significantly hotter than the Cuisinart model I replaced, and having the choice between single serve and a full carafe is wonderful, as is having the choice of using a pod on the single serve side if I wish.  Brewing time for the carafe is average,  I would say,  but don't expect the single serve side to be as speedy as a Keurig, because it isn't. It's not a lengthy process by any means, but it does take longer than a dedicated pod brewer. Also, make sure not to overfill the filter on the single side, or it will definitely spit grounds into your mug. Single brew will accommodate any mug size.

I didn't need a new coffeemaker, but I saw this baby in an email advertisement from another company and was intrigued with the dual brewing option.  I like flavored coffees and considered the merits of a Keurig unit but the cost of the coffees was a turnoff.  I can quickly brew a regular coffee for my husband and a flavored one for myself in just a few minutes with this unit using regular bags of coffee.  The single serve side doesn't even require a paper filter and I find myself using it almost daily and brewing a pot only occasionally.  The programming feature makes my husband's workday mornings a bit more streamlined by saving him a stop for his morning cup of coffee.  I'm really pleased with the flavor of the coffee made in this unit too.  I would recommend this product.",5,2014-02-09,,True,,So convenient,,

4035,1,"I've been using this coffeemaker for a couple of weeks, and it's the absolute best. I'd wanted to step up from a cheap Mr. Coffee machine to something with a few more bells and whistles, but I'm not made of money -- this got such great reviews, and offered everything I was looking for. And I'm very pleased.<br /><br />Easy operation. Simple controls. The heating element is very good -- the water gets much hotter than in my cheaper machines, and so makes better coffee.<br /><br />The single-cup side is the BEST. I didn't want to be married to the K-cup system (largely because of price) and this allows me to brew single cups of any kind of coffee I like. The filter pulls out, empties and rinses quickly and easily, pops right back in, and I can spoon in some ground coffee. My husband doesn't drink coffee (!!) so this is ideal for afternoons/evenings when I just want one cup -- I've also used it for a quick cup of hot water for tea or hot chocolate. The adjustable base is brilliant, so that you can immediately switch it to accommodate a different size mug.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the warmer plate under the carafe, which normally has an auto-shutoff at two hours, turns off if you flip the switch to the single-cup side. I discovered this when I made a cup of tea for my husband, and my coffee in the carafe went lukewarm. Like I said, it's a small complaint, because it's not going to come up that often.<br /><br />Okay, one more complaint. It's about a quarter-inch too tall fit under my cabinets on the kitchen counter. But that that's not Hamilton Beach's fault.<br /><br />Also, it's gorgeous. It looks really great. Honestly, it looks expensive, even though it's not. A terrific coffeemaker.",4,2014-01-10,,True,,Excellent coffeemaker at a good price,,

It does not make too much noise but it's not entirely quiet. I've used it for 4 weeks now and only have one minor &#34;complaint&#34;:<br /><br />You cannot have the two lids on the top of the coffee maker open at the same time. The larger lid is where you put the coffee filter in and the lid behind it is for the water reservoir. After I brew coffee I'd like to keep both compartments open to allow the moisture to dry out before the next brew. This is not possible.

I really wanted to purchase the version that has the option of using k cups on the single serve side, but the reviews were pretty bad on that coffee maker so I didn't want to take the risk.

The single serving side has a built in filter so all you have to do is add coffee grounds, pods are not necessary.  The pot side does require either a reusable filter or the paper ones.<br /><br />Also, my coffee pot was not wrapped well and fell out when we opened it and broke so be mindful of that.

Single side will hold around 16-20 oz of water if you like big cups! Does have piece for kpods although ive been using ground coffee since it has that feature as well. Brews coffee pretty quickly on both sides for a standard coffee pot. Bold setting just brews it slower. Carafe side is standard 12-cup. This was a great investment.

I previously owned a keurig, which I will admit I loved for several years, but when it was time to replace that I wanted to try something different. I mainly use the single serve side and I LOVE that part of it. My cup of coffee is ready, I feel, just as quickly as it was with my keurig. I can program it to brew at a certain time, which is another plus. I also love that when I have people over, I am able to brew a full pot of coffee, instead of just one cup at a time like it was with my keurig.

It is easy to use and easy to maintain.  In short, I love it.  I have always said that I really don't drink coffee, but that was not entirely accurate.  What I meant was that I did not like like BAD coffee, and most coffee (from various sources) is terrible.  This machine makes a great cup of coffee and I am very happy with it.

Then I had the opportunity to use one at a vacation rental and that sealed the deal.  After doing comparison review research on similar models.  I ordered one as soon as I got home.  I appreciate the functionality of it and it makes coffee as good as or better than any traditional drip maker.<br /><br />I am an early riser and usually brew a single cup for my early morning cup(s) and set up the carafe to brew when my husband gets up and we start our day.  I particularly like the separate water reservoirs. I can make a single cup without any involvement with the carafe side----no heating of the water, no heating of the warming plate, etc. It's a simple thing to remember to switch from single to carafe side for brewing. I have philosophical opposition to K cups so the ability to use regular coffee or filtered pods in the single side is great.  Cleaning the provided &#34;forever filter&#34; of the single side is easy.  I use both tall and regular mugs---the ability to raise the cup so there are no spatters is convenient.<br /><br />The location for filling the main reservoir is somewhat inconvenient as it has smallish openings and is completely in the back and behind the filter cover.  I quickly learned to turn the pot to make it easier---I actually put small felt pads on the rubber feet so it would be easier to turn.  Filling the single cup reservoir is easy.<br /><br />I was concerned when I started looking for this one that it had been replaced by the model that accepts K cups---but fortunately it was available.

I use the single serve unit the most and happy to have the larger carafe for company.  I don't use the &#34;pod&#34; feature on the single serve.

It works well, though I can't speak for long term performance yet.  It brews a 12-cup pot 1 minute slower than my Cuisinart brews 12 cups, but I can live with that.  Besides the single cup convenience, the major differences are that this Brewer has no water filter, it's slightly slower brewing, and it's slightly larger than the Cuisinart.  I prefer to brew the single cup using a paper filter as I have in the past.  It's less messy than the  enclosed permanent filter.  I do like the single cup feature, though 14 ounces is barely adequate.

4134,1,Great coffee maker. We were spending too much $$$ on k-cups so we went back to a coffee pot with a single serve option. Best decision!,5,2016-05-10,3.0,True,,No more k-cups,,
4135,1,"Wow, I love this coffee maker. First off, it's simple to operate. It gives me the flexability to do a full pot, partial pot or single serving. The feel of the coffee maker is good; good sitting on the counter, the water container is easily accessed, the water gage on the side is accurate and the coffee tastes great. We have worked both the 'strong' option and 'default' optionsl both produce good tasting coffee.I am very pleased.<br /><br />I would suggest paying a tad more for the metallic/gold filter basket (a separate item)...to simplify filling and clreaning the grounds. I will say that the plain, white or buff filters worked great. The 12 cup option is a bit of a stretch for the paper filters....so, a basket would be a better bet if you constantly make 12 cups.<br /><br />Addendum 4/27/2017  the Coffee Filter 60765 is a nice gold filter but the sides of this permanent filter are too low for 10-12 cups causing grounds to flood into the filter holder, pot and your mug. Though the filter is made well and works great when making 8 or less cups, I recommend using paper filters instead (#4 or basket style, better). Otherwise, after heavy usage the last two weeks, this coffee maker does a fine job for both large volumes and 1-3 cups.",5,2017-04-04,3.0,True,,Great coffee maker,,

4154,1,"Carafe, tumbler, or cup - &#34;having it my way&#34;! The cleverest coffee pot. Makes a single cup very quickly and with no splatter or mess. Is a pretty quick brew, even for a carafe full.",5,2017-02-19,,True,,My Way!!,,
4155,1,"Secretly glad our Cuisinart Brew Central bit the dust, this maker advertised the bells and whistles and then some. First, this purchase was for a brand new item. Unpacked and fingerprints were evident on the &#34;stainless steel&#34; as well as a tiny etched rust spot. This must be something that manufacturers are not quality controlling (another brand also arrived with fingerprints).<br /><br />The Good: (1) It looks really nice. (2) Can be used with some pods (not a crucial option, but hey, why not?  (3) Came with a gold permanent filter for the single serve basket. (4) No annoying repetitive beeps at the end of the brew cycle. (5) Easy access to water tank without the water running down the back, which the Cuisinart did.<br /><br />None of the &#34;Good&#34; could make up for the &#34;Bad&#34; - (1) The aforementioned handling of a new item apparent upon opening.  (2)The blue display panel and related buttons are not represented well in the pictures from the manufacturer. Let me say that these were the ugliest, brightest blue lights that literally will blind you in the morning if you like to wake up and keep the kitchen lights low. If you do not turn on kitchen lights, these lights will blind you to the point you cannot see past the maker - like your cup better be in front of the machine and not to the side.  (3) The blue lights are tacky and remind me of the old Lite-Brite toy from childhood - but much, much brighter.  (4) No permanent filter for the full carafe side - every other maker provides it for free. Only the single serve side gets the gold filter.  (5) Though easy access to the water tanks, the covers are flimsy - enough so that steam lifts the lid. You will lose a full cup to steam, so plan on adding one extra cup of water if you want an exact measure.  (6) An attached carafe lid that is not removable. Yuck - I can see gunky stuff accumulating over time.  (7) No variable hot plate setting. It's one temp, no option to adjust. (8) If you don't own a microwave, buy one. This maker brews a tepid pot immediately upon brewing. It is impossible to cause any harm from drinking or spilling it accidentally. I'm talking under 120 degrees.<br /><br />Number 8 was the deal breaker, though listed last on my review. The Cuisinart that died (2650 model) brewed hot (burn potential) and the heat plate also kept it that hot. I am one who cannot eat piping hot pizza or drink piping hot coffee except in small doses or it will burn my tongue. This maker brews at the bottom notch of &#34;hot&#34;, it was near room temp half way through the cup.  Why let a microwave ruin the flavor of your coffee if the maker claims to make the perfect tasting hot brew?<br /><br />We returned the maker and chose another. Temperature is kind of important if you want a hot cup of joe. Never used the single side, though reviewers have made statements that it fails to deliver also. But for the price, one would reasonably expect hot coffee with a full carafe. I pulled out our back-up Proctor-Silex basic model maker and the temperature of that $19 model beats the heck out of Hamilton Beach's temperature delivery. Silly me for wanting a maker with programmable features! (PS: the replacement maker purchased was another Cuisinart - Perfect Temp which was not impressive either. The 3rd time's the charm - the Zojurishi Thermal maker - it advertises and delivers the temperature that it promises. Brews at 195 and in the pot at 170, which held for another 1.5 hours. 4 hours later, 160 degrees. Now that's impressive!!)",1,2018-02-15,,True,,Microwave Not Included. Expecting Piping Hot Coffee? Well You Are Just Too Demanding and Asking For Too Much.,,

4169,1,This is our second purchase and we really like this coffee maker.

4178,1,"I drink one cup to go in the morning and my husband takes a thermos. It works great for that. You can pre set the 12 cup to brew in the morning. However we grind and brew our beans fresh, just do. It depends but my husband often brews my single in the travel mug. Prepares his 12 cup when I go out to get my single if he wasn't there to flip the switch to the carafe when the one mug finishes then I do it. The carafe stays on hot for a while before turning off so he has plenty of time to get ready for work. The 12 cup carafe side has a window for the water level. And requires a filter. The one mug side has a permanent filter that just needs rinsing and you pour in water ever water amount you are using. If I am at home that day I often use my home coffee mug. The coffee maker has 3 levels of height for a coffee cup. The travel mug a slightly shorter mug and a regular size coffee mug. Whichever one you are using you use that to measure the water. As far as coffee there is a BOLD brew option but other than that you have to test out your personal preference. aprox. One tablespoon per 8 oz cup. Enjoy! Ps the travel mug doesn't keep the coffee warm too long, it is plastic inside. If you want HOT coffee for a while on the go you will need to invest in a good travel mug.",5,2014-02-16,,True,,Works great!,,
4179,1,I use this coffee maker every day and it works like a champ. The controls are easy to figure out without having to dig out the manual and it makes good coffee. I've used the single-serve side a couple of times and that worked to brew coffee into a travel mug with no problems. Just remember to flip the switch back to the full pot side before setting the maker to brew coffee the next morning or you'll be disappointed. Not that I've done that.

4181,1,"I purchased this coffee maker a few days ago. I also purchased a used one in &#34;very good condition&#34;, which is described as being new but having damage to the original packaging and shipped from Amazon Warehouse. This saved me $30. The product arrived in a Hamilton Beach Box, all of the pieces and manual were present. The typical plastic packaging on each individual piece was not present, but this only means less trash for me. No scratches or dents were found, looks brand new and never used. The coffee maker has worked great, no complaints here. I have used both sides of the machine. The single serve side does take a bit longer to brew a cup when the &#34;bold&#34; function is selected. (Approximately 4-5 mins.) I work from home, so it is not a big deal to wait and it is great not to have to brew extra coffee in the afternoon if I get the craving for a single cup. I also have not had any issues with overflow, I use the cup I plan to fill with coffee to measure the accurate amount of water. Also, as other reviewers have said, regular grounds can go directly in to the single serve side and a permanent filter is included. I guess my only complaint is there is a small lip on the inside of the plastic rim on the carafe, which holds a little water when turned over to air dry. Just an annoyance really, not an issue.  I will update if discovered at a later date that indeed buying the &#34;very good used&#34; option turns out to be a bad idea.",5,2015-10-01,,True,,"I also purchased a used one in ""very good condition"", which is described as being new but ...",,

We rarely use the travel mug side, although it was a great alternative for a Keurig replacement at the time.<br /><br />Edit 2 years in: Works great still. Nothing wrong with it, the carafe most likely needs to be replaced (it’s just old and has coffee stains that won’t come out with vigorous scrubbing). And the spring for the basket which is supposed to stop the coffee flow when you pull out the carafe in mid brew is really stiff. Makes it a little bit of an art to put it back in without causing a small mess.

Very easy to pour water in, put coffee or tea in the reusable filter and its ready fast. The carafe part is good too, doesnt drip at all, kept warm for hours. I dont have anything negative to say about this yet. I was debating this or the new flexbrew that could do k-cups but why invest in a more expensive mode, more expensive kcups? Only takes a few seconds to scoop my own ground coffee in and shake it out/rinse once done.

4184,1,"This is the first coffee maker I've used on a regular basis.  I've  been using it a little over a year.  With a long commute and a newborn, I started making up about 7-8 cups (as marked) on the carafe several times per week and carrying it with me in a vacuum bottle.  My wife gets up ahead of me and typically uses a pre-made Melitta pod in the small maker on the side.  We've both been very satisfied with the maker.  At first, it didn't seem to be very good, and then I experimented with some bottled spring water.  Bingo!  Great coffee every time.  Turns out our local tap water leaves a terrible aftertaste when used to make coffee, but the spring water solved that.  I use fresh ground coffee and bottled water and have been very satisfied.  We often make a smaller batch on weekends (4-5 cups) and it also turns out great.  I've not experimented with the automatic settings, so I can't speak to that.

4206,1,"I wanted to like this coffee maker, mostly because it was a Christmas gift for my mother and I wanted it to work out, but no dice. It's made of sort of flimsy plastic, which made me nervous from the get go. Then the warming plate started to burn, but my mom sensed my nervousness and convinced me it's normal (I get the feeling is not). Then the print started to rub off the buttons. Then we realized we couldn't find pods for the single-serve to save our lives.<br /><br />And then this morning, a little over five months after Christmas, the thing literally sputtered and died. So... that's great.",2,2015-06-04,,True,,"RIP, O Short-Lived Machine",,

I tried to brew a pot of coffee with Folgers Columbian in the can, both regular and the next time on the &#34;bold&#34; settings with extra coffee. It had no coffee taste at all compared to a K-cup. I then tried coffee beans. I ground them myself and brewed a pot of coffee. It was an acceptable pot of coffee but no where near the Keurig and the K-cup. The closest I came to a &#34;good&#34; cup of coffee was when I opened a k-cup and put it in the single serve side. I will be bringing this coffee maker back and staying with my Keurig.",2,2015-03-02,,,,Doesn't compare to a Keurig,,

The heating element quit and no longer brews. it just sits there and does nothing. The single serving side still works but i'm going to have to scrap the thing. I received this as a gift and it was what i wanted. There really aren't any other options that brew both one cup and a full 12 cup carafe.  I guess Hamilton Beach products aren't well made.

Only difference is the single serving is on the side. Otherwise everything else is the same plus this one comes with the travel cup. Makes a wonderful pot of coffee. I love that I can set it up easily. The only thing I would change is the heating element only stays<br />warm for 2 hours. In the past I've had some that stayed on for 4 hours. Coffee is kept hot. I'm home all day and drink a lot of coffee, so love that after I finish the pot I can make single servings with the same pot. Up until now I had to also keep my Keurig on the counter. With this I save space on the counter for other things. I would certainly recommend this to other serious coffee drinkers.",5,2014-07-24,,,,Great Cuppa Coffee,,

I had mine on single serve and forgot to switch it back to pot. Imagine my surprise when there was no coffee in the morning lol. I love that it fills my travel mugs regardless of size.

We fixed the problem by cutting a stack of filter papers to 5.5 inches diameter and we put one paper between the screen and it's holder for each cup.  My wife is the coffee drinker in the house.

Has held up very well. Would recommend anytime.",5,2017-11-20,,True,,Awesome coffee maker.,,
4332,1,"I bought this coffeemaker as it was highly rated, and overall I would give it 4-4.5 stars. the only issue was the first one leaked water. After every use there would be a 2-3 tablespoons of water on the counter, underneath the unit, when it finished brewing. Made a painless return/replacement and new unit seems fine after a couple of weeks of daily use.<br /><br />The great thing about this coffeemaker is you can brew a whole pot, or use the side unit and brew into anything up to about a 14 oz mug or travel mug. can't do both at the same time, though.<br /><br />I use the side brewer in the afternoon sometimes, when I need a pick-me-up, and don't have the hassle of cleaning the pot and filter basket.

I've run probably 50 cups of coffee / hot water through the single serve portion of the coffee maker and I cannot get rid of the plastic taste.  It ruins my coffee, but the need for the caffine triumphs and I force myself to drink it.  It's borderline gross.  I use the same Merlina coffee pods at home and that coffee is great.  Hamilton Beach changed something in their manufacturing process and now the end result is borderline gross.",2,2016-01-14,12.0,True,,Little coffee with your plastic taste?,,
4335,1,"This is a great coffee maker. You can brew single cup or multiple. It's simple to use. you can program it to brew ... you can also choose a bold coffee (which I'm particularly fond of)... note, it does take up a decent portion of your counter (more noticeable with the limited countertop space I have)...  the only downside is that I found a single cup brews a lot slower than other coffee makers. If I'm using my large cup, I believe it takes around 7 minutes. Whereas my parents takes about 4. Approx.",4,2017-06-28,,True,,Awesome but brews kind of slow,,
4336,1,"My husband said it was his favorite Christmas present. He said it brews the best coffee he has had every time. It easily brews a single cup and a whole pot. He can switch easily back and forth, set the timer for either one, or just brew it as he wants. It uses the Senseo pods for the single brew side if wanted, or you can use your own coffee. The only thing I wish was available were pods in tea and hot cocoa the way they are in the Keurig brand but so far I've only been able to find coffee. We did buy the  Hamilton Beach 80675 Permanent Gold Tone Filter, 8 to 12-Cups for the full pot side so that we didn't have to continue to buy paper filters and it fits perfectly. I know others have said that the Hamilton Beach Flex Brew brews the Keurig but I have also heard that it tastes like plastic and this one absolutely doesn't which is why I chose it instead.",5,2014-12-28,2.0,True,,Better than the Flex Brew,,
4337,1,"What I really love about this machine was/is the concept. However, when I was deciding to purchase, I thought that it required the Senseo pads for the Single cup brew as there was very little info in the product features.<br /><br />After receiving it, I was pleasantly surprised that the single cup brewing contained a little permanent filter that can be used with standard coffee grinds, awesome don't need to pay for the Senseo if I don't want to.<br /><br />Last night was perfect test of the single cup concept. I had already programmed and prepped my 3AM standard coffee brew, however I still wanted a cup of coffee . I switched over to the single cup and brewed my cup, then switched back and pressed the program button to ensure it would still brew the main pot at 3am. Worked like a charm!!

4364,1,"I fought my husband over buying this.  I did not want it initially.  We have limited counter space and I made sure he measured to ensure it would fit on the counter top.  We also have to run this through a transformer while we're posted overseas, so that means the location was limited to an even smaller space.  After it arrived, it was bigger than I expected for counter space. The only complete con to this machine is the cord is really really short so the space we can use it in was even smaller!  Despite the cons for the machine, it works exactly as we intended it.<br /><br />In the mornings we can choose to do an individual cup, and the machine takes senseo coffee pods for those interested.  Alternatively, we can brew a full pot.  The biggest plus is the machine turns off after about 2 hours. If you brew the individual cup, it shuts off when done.  A few times I've forgotten to place a cup underneath the individual side and made a giant mess.  The individual side can fit all types of cups and the base turns over and you can stack it.<br /><br />Despite my original apprehension and the cord and size issues, I'm glad we bought it.",5,2016-02-13,,True,,"Didn't want at first, changed my mind",,

4461,1,The two negatives are that it does not have a temperature adjustor and the single side brews a rather warmish cup that requires a trip to the microwave to be near hot for the length of time it takes to drink it; and that it is near impossible to get the water into the single side without spilling some of the contents on your countertop.,3,2018-01-11,,True,,No Heat Control; Loading Spillage,,

I've waited months to write this to give it a fair chance, but was motivated to finally review it after bad coffee this morning. The single serve side brews warm, not hot, coffee and nine times out of ten is riddled with coffee grounds. The overflowing coffee grounds are because both sides take so much coffee grounds to brew a decently strong cup - even on the 'bold' setting. Another frustration. The carafe side is wildly inconsistent - sometimes I'll get a decent cup of coffee, but other times for no rhyme or reason (like this morning, with two attempts) I'll get coffee-flavored water, again even using the 'bold' setting.<br /><br />This is my first, and last, Hamilton Beach purchase.",1,2015-07-29,7.0,True,,Not impressed,,

4496,1,"After reading most of the reviews, i bought this unit to provide us with the K-Cup convenience of use: it works just fine. For those who want a quick cup or two rather than a pot, then the mini-basket that eliminates the need for the expensive K's will be a financial blessing. We purchased a variety of cup from Amazon and Ebay to keep costs acceptable but have found that simply tossing a scoop of coffee into the mini is DEFINITELY the best solution (no pun intended) to having a morning quickie... oh,i did it again.<br /><br />Use and Performance: The quality of the brew produced is controlled, mostly, by the coffee used: garbage in - garbage out. The finished brew is quite hot from all of the three modes of use and the machine keeps the pot nice and toasty for an hour.  To extent the heating time past an hour, i just turn the brewer off-and-on which action resets the timer. The learning curve is quite short as the required steps mimic those of a regular drip or K-Cup machine. The fit of some manufacturers' cups can be quite tight and the somewhat flimsy-looking cutter can not pierce the heavy duty construction of certain cups. I solved the first problem by applying continuous-but-gentle pressure and the latter by simply tearing the bottom of the tank factory-produced cup, moving the piercing device aside, and inserting the now-ready cup. The use of the mini-basket/K-Cup adapter is tooooo easy and fast.<br /><br />My purchase did not include a mug... snivel, but then i like a mug with a handle, particularly during the duration of my morning oblivious-to-the-world wake-up period.<br /><br />Buy it - you'll be happy and less financially strained if you like only a cup or two.",5,2014-07-22,,True,,A Great Alternative To Enriching Keurig!,,

The only problem I've found is although the single cup side as a permanent filter, I prefer a paper filter and they are very hard to find this size and when I have found them they are not tall enough and the grounds from finely ground coffee sometimes overflow the filter and get onto my cup. Overall though, it's perfect for us.",5,2018-06-18,,True,,"His and Hers, works well!",,
4506,1,I love this coffee machine it’s nice that you can make just one cup of coffee or 12 cups. One thing that is confusing though is it says it takes pods but the only pod it takes is the kind that looks like a coffee filter like you use in the 12 pot area. Just remember the pods that go inside a keriug this coffee maker doesn’t take. 😩 Other than that my father and I can get a long now that I’m not making his pot dirty.😂😂,5,2017-11-22,,True,,Excellent investment,,
4507,1,"I like the coffee pot.  My cuisinart coffee pot started linking like mad so had to chuck it and decided to try this pot based on reviews and the fact I could make one cup coffee if I want to.  It is a good pot (so far anyway) but the drawbacks when compared to my old pot as I see them are: hot plate could keep the coffee a little hotter but it is okay; the hot plate only stays hot for two hours (on my old one you could set it for 2,3, or 4 hours.  I kept it on four hours😀); and my old one had an alarm to tell me when coffee was ready and when the hot plate was about to shut off. I miss that.  All in all I think I preferred my old pot but not enough to go thru the torture of repacking and returning this one!  And being able to make one cup and that one cup can be a mug, small cup, or travel size cup is a big plus.  Also this one is easier to pour the water in and the water doesn't link out when pouring it in the machine.",4,2015-04-25,,True,,I like it,,
4508,1,"So, like you all ,I've been a coffeeholic for many years. Like you ,I've struggled to have a decent maker in my kitchen. I recently finished up with my Cuisinart mod#CHW-12. Had it for 5yrs. It got to point of no longer producing a well tasting cup. We did the Vinigar cleaning etc. So, i spent MANY hours searching online for a decent Maker. Problem was the abundance of poor reviews encompassing many manufacturers!  It's  now 2018 and we have trouble creating a Kit Coffee Brewer thats decent!  W.T.F!  I did a switch and desired a maker that will produce a single cup as wife n i both have coffee at different times and mostly need the one 16oz cup. In searching for the 12cup Carafe / or single cup Maker ,my choices became limited. Read the reviews and pulled the trigger on this. It's only been 1wk now but i can honestly state that it is the BEST maker I've ever used! I ran a full 12cup Carafe first off, thn dumped. Then did same for the single cup side. ( full 14oz). Then ran 12cups clean water through for both. Then did the Coffee that I'll drink. No issues. Had to play round wth the exact amount of grounds for the single side so to get the outcome i desired. Has clock, easy to pre prog., and, the single side will turn off when done. The Carafe side will stay on (hot plate) for 2hrs after brewing complete. You can simply press On/Off button to turn off anytime. For those who have an over-spilling issue with the grounds within the gold filter basket?, you are using TOO MANY grounds!  The single side comes with a gold reusable filter which also encompasses two - Level markers. One is min and the other is Max. If you fill above the Max level, WELL, overflow of grounds will prob. occur. On the Amazon site you'll see the Reusable filter for the Carafe side in &#34; frequently ordered with&#34;. I also ordered that as i don't like paper filters. It performs well. Water level for Carafe is helpful. It's towards the right rear, on the side. It's accurate. Brew time for 12 cups was good. I've learned to warm up my Mug when using single side as it is not as hot as Carafe as no hot plate for the Mug. I use single side to run water for tea as well.  What would make this model perfect? If it sounded out a tone when brewing is complete. It also has No charcoal filter as with my Cuisinart. No biggie as i always have used filtered water to begin with. Coffee is better when there's no Chlorine in the H2O! Filling either the Carafe or single side is easy and Max level markers are visible enough to get it right. Carafe pours very well and i like that the Carafe lid stays attached as u simply press thumb to open but it's not required to pour. Single side grounds chamber pulls out easily. Single side has a bottom (under mug/cup) that reverses to then become a elevator to bring cup higher if you'd like. I brewed a cup at lowest level without any spill or splatter. It drips slow enough that i don't believe i need to elevate my mug. This model also looks fantastic, Beautiful!  Has a &#34;Bold&#34; brew mode for both Carafe n Sing. The brewing is slower, so u gt a richer brew. Light on clock only on when unit is ON. Has seperate green light that indicates you are using &#34;Program&#34; mode. I don't use &#34;Pods&#34; but if i did the manual states that &#34;Senseo&#34; Pods will work. Note that unit will only brew one side at a time. It cannot brew both sides at once. Very pleased so far. If any issues I'll update here. P.s. if Manufacturer reads this, you may want to consider modifying so to have an end of brew audible tone! Jst a thought.  Update!; 1/5/18. Jst did 2 Lg mugs for me ( nine- 8oz cups), using Carafe of course. Wife then needed to do her single 14oz using of course the Single serv side. When throwing the slide switch over to Single, it turns off the Carafe side. So, yeah, hot plate under Carafe is still hot, but, it's now off. So, in future, wife does her single, first, then i do Carafe. UPDATE ; 1/22/18-  3wks now and NO ISSUES!  When removing coffee filled Carafe, absolutely no spilling onto hot plate. The spring loaded valve above, performing well. Reviewers having the Hot plate discoloration or burning may be turning unit on with a Hot plate thats dirty. I make sure plate is clean /dry before and after ea. use. I make sure bottom of Carafe is clean/ dry as well.

4510,1,"My wife and I have had this coffee maker for a month, and we love it. Well, we love HALF of it -- the left half. We've probably made more than 100 cups of coffee on the single-serve side, and every single one has been terrific, with better taste than one typically gets from making a full pot of coffee. And with the single-serve side, we're actually using LESS coffee than we were using with our previous coffee maker, which was a standard &#34;carafe&#34; style coffee maker. (In fact, we're using about HALF as much coffee as we were using with the old coffee maker.) One of the issues that this coffee maker solves is that my wife likes lightly brewed flavored coffee, while I like dark-roast coffee that is brewed for hand-to-hand combat. ;-) This coffee maker works well in that type of environment.<br /><br />So it turns out that we like the single-serve side so much that, one month and more than 100 cups of coffee later, we have yet to use the carafe side of the coffee maker. Of course, your mileage may vary, depending upon your own brewing situation. And I'm sure we will use the carafe side the next time we have guests over for dinner. But for now, the single-serve side is doing a fine job all by itself....",5,2016-07-03,477.0,True,,Terrific Coffee Maker,,
4511,1,"I love, love, love this coffee maker!  Usually I am the only coffee drinker in the house so the ability to make one cup of coffee without having to use expensive pods has been wonderful.  It's nice that I can use pods if I choose to, but the one-cup filter works great with my own ground coffee.  I can brew directly into a travel cup if I want to or I can use a standard coffee mug if I'm going to be drinking my coffee at home. The machine shuts off automatically when one-cup brewing is finished and I never have to worry about whether I remembered to turn it off or not.<br /><br />When I have company I can brew a full pot, a half-pot, whatever quantity I need.  It's incredibly easy to switch from one-cup to carafe brewing--there's just one button to slide to the other setting and it's ready to go.  There's no need for paper coffee filters so there's less expense and less waste and I've never had any problems with leakage or poor functioning.<br /><br />This coffee maker is a great mash-up of single-brew coffee and carafe coffee.  If I had been asked to design the perfect coffee maker, this is what I would have designed...but the folks at Hamilton Beach took care of that for me.  Well done, Hamilton Beach!",5,2016-03-15,100.0,True,,"Finally, a versatile coffee maker!",,
4512,1,"WE LOVE THIS COFFEE MAKER!  Here's why...<br />Our Keurig had been on the fritz, and after much troubleshooting, we decided to search for a new coffee maker.  I've owned 3 Keurigs, the most recent one being a K425 model with carafe.  We really only used the carafe in the morning and that really didn't work all that great for us.  We would use or own grounds, but to get 2 cups worth, you'd have to brew it as a 4-5 cup pot and it was still kinda weak, even though we used the large sized reusable filter pod (designed for the carafe) full of grounds.  So, many times we'd just brew 2 separate cups, especially since my husband drinks regular coffee while I've been drinking mainly decaf.  He wanted to go back to a traditional programmable coffee pot.  That was fine by me, so long as it had an auto off.  I searched, but I still wanted my single serve machine.  So, I saw this one and just kept coming back to it.  It really seemed to have all that we were looking for:  *Traditional coffee pot  *Programmable  *Auto off  *Single serve.  No, it doesn't use K-cups, but that wasn't really a problem for me since we mostly used our own coffee grounds anyway.  So I bought it and I am not disappointed.  I can tell you this, of the critiques I found in the reviews, there are 2 I'd like to comment on: the bright light and the single serve filter.  First, I find the green light on the program button to be very, very bright.  I fixed this by coloring over it with a black sharpie.  It doesn't block out the light, it just dims it, so it's still green, just not blindingly so.  Second, the wire filter basket on the single serve side works just fine, but if you want zero sediment, I have a recommendation.  I tried some of the &#34;use your own pod&#34; filters made for Senseo style coffee makers based on a suggestion from a reviewer and it works okay, but I found something that I find works even better.  Buy the #2 sized cone style paper coffee filters.  Cut across the filter about an inch from the top to make the cone smaller.  Place the paper filter inside the wire filter that fits in the single serve basket.  It works perfectly!",5,2018-07-17,15.0,True,,"Better than my Keurig, by far!",,

4515,1,"I love this coffee maker. I purchased this a few years ago, except I paid for the travel mug (a waste of money). This time I just want the coffe maker.  Our other one still makes coffee, but we weren't as careful with the hot plate as we should have been (we put the carafe on it wet frequently, I'm sure thats a no-no) and it has worn out and rusted, made me nervous. So its time to replace. I will admit, I was not happy the hot plate rusted and became a hazard in 3 years and I did look at other coffee makers, but this one really does meet all our needs: it is still working great, it is easy enough that even my husband can make his coffee  (I'm not joking he is not good with appliances), it makes a small pot of tea in less then 2 minutes. No other coffee maker did that and looks this nice and bonus; for this price. So I will accept accountability, this time for the hot plate rusting and I will do my due diligence in placing a dry carafe on the hot plate, if it rust again in 3 years I will write the company.<br />So for me it is a simple choice: I set my husband coffee with the timer the night before and when he gets up he has coffee, it makes a small pot if tea (16 oz)<br />in less then 2 minutes (making my toast takes longer), the right side is multi-functional for brewing (no it won't take k-cups) it looks really nice, the coffee is hot, the water is very hot.<br />Yes I recommend this Hamilton Beach Coffee maker.

4562,1,"I got this coffee maker for Christmas and it is awesome!  The 12 cup carafe is great because our family usually drinks several cups in thr morning and its great how it stays hot for as long as we need it.  I had a Crusinart with w metal double wall carafe which didn't have a heater plate so it would always need to be nuked for 30 seconds after I poured it and added my half & half cream.  This one maintains the hot coffee at 191 degrees for as long as you need it, plus as an added bonus you can brew a single cup on the left side to make decaf, tea, hot chocolate or just hot water for anything else like Ramen Noodles.  It comes out at 191 degrees just like the coffee maker side and starts flowing within like 5 seconds after you push the start button.  A full cup flows out in approximately 2 mins which is the correct time to brew or seep a teabag or drip grind coffee.  The single side comes with a gold metal basket to catch the grounds and includes a pod holder for coffee pods (not K-cups) but the kind you find in most hotel room coffee pots.  I can make a K-cup using the single side by just peeling the top off the K-cup and dumping the contents into the gold filter then discarding the empty K-cup, quick & easy.  Another thing I like is the easy to set programming of the carafe side cause I like to have my pot of coffee ready when I get up and some machines are not easy to program.  Oh and the single side has 3 adjustable levels to hold travel mugs, large cups or small cups without it dripping and splashing out of the cup.  There is one con if you can call it that, it’s that the right side basket requires a paper filter.  I was kinda bummed that it also didn’t include a gold screen filter like the single side.  I have one on order from Amazon that fits this coffee maker and it was an additional $5.75 as an add-on item so I highly recommend you add that to your order, it makes life a lot easier than dealing with those paper filters that could collapse and drop grinds into your carafe.

It is your, come to be expected, 12 cup, drip, paper filter, coffee maker. Its 12 cup reservoir, separate from the single brew side, has a handy see though fill gauge on the right side. In some cases this may be useful, but i like to fill my carafe to measure and pour it into the reservoir. The controls, front and center are simple, either or, single serve/carafe. The on/off button is placed below. The clock keeps time and gives the option to program a delayed brew, providing a blue glow when set. This coffee maker provides a bold brew setting... I don't know what this affects, I tried with it on and off, coffee is still black in the end. Moving over to the single brew side. This is what allows for a 5 star review, the thing is well designed. 1. Permanent loose grind, fine mesh, coffee filter. 2. Adapter for coffee pods. 3. Adjustable cup base. The reason I like it so much is, because prefer vacuum insulated mugs; the size of these mugs, big and tall, prevent me from a simple process with other coffee makers. Check out my photo, that is a 16 oz vacuum insulated mug, pretty big, but it fits! All i had to do was take out all of the adjustable bases and viola! The reservoir may only state 14 oz but it can do almost 20, just ignore the max fill line. It produces good coffee, with good coffee.",5,2015-03-04,41.0,,,This coffee maker is the cream!,,
4564,1,"This coffee maker fails one of the most basic requirements of a good coffee maker: water dispersion is HORRIBLE. You effectively end up wasting a lot of coffee since the sprayer up top only focuses on the middle of the basket. I can brew a whole batch and have dry grounds after it's done brewing.<br />Also, the hot plate at the bottom is way too hot. It slowly burns your coffee. At first I thought it was the beans I was buying, but when I tasted it fresh out of the brewer and compared it to a cup a couple of hours later, the taste was dramatically different.<br />If you want the novelty of a single cup brewer (because that's all it really is), then get this. BUT if you care about being able to adjust the strength of your coffee, or more importantly, not wasting any coffee, then do not get this instrument.",1,2017-11-08,,,,Wastes Coffee Grounds,,

The drip pauses when you pull the carafe which is handy, and prevents coffee from burning on the hot plate.<br /><br />Overall great buy. My only complaint, which is probably just impatience, is the BOLD brew option is very slow. It takes about 9 minutes to brew half a pot (6 cups).

I can prepare mine the night before and it's ready just before my alarm goes off.  The carafe does not drip when you pour out of it like our previous one.

Our son likes his coffee very strong, as in an espresso strength, so he can make one cup that way & for the rest of us, we can have our whole pot normal. We really like this feature. Some people think it is a little slow when waiting for a pot but we usually set it to start up at a certain time in the morning & it is ready when we get up.

4579,1,We very much enjoyed this machine.  The one cup brewer was used daily.  It was great to be able to brew directly into our travel cup and go.  12 cup side worked fine and still does.  The problem with this machine is the reservoir for the single cup side now leaks during the brew of every cup. Makes a small mess on the machine and the counter.  We will stick with this and deal with the leaks for now.  I have not found any other machine that looks like it would be a good replacement.

4594,1,"I started out loving this coffee maker.  It was so nice having the option of a single cup or a carafe.  I loved that it was programmable so that I could have a hot cup of coffee right when I woke up.  Unfortunately after one month of use it began to give me problems.  Some days it would brew a great cup of coffee.  Then the next day it would brew a terrible cup of coffee.  When it would brew a bad cup or carafe I would look at the filter and see that not all of the grounds had been saturated in water.  So something was happening with the water output.  Obviously, if the water is not saturating the grounds it's going to make a very weak cup of coffee.  It would do this with both the single cup side and the carafe side.  I thought it was me not paying attention to how much water I was putting in the reservoir.  I became extremely careful with how much water and how many coffee grounds I was adding.  It started happening more frequently and I knew it was the machine and not user error.  After calling the company and realizing I would have to pay for the shipping to send it back plus the shipping to have it replaced I decided it wasn't worth the money or the hassle.  Very frustratig considering I bought this less than three months ago.  This is the second coffee maker I've bought in the past year.  I bought an expensive Cuisinart last year and that broke on me too.  I can't seem to find one that is reliable and just simply brews a good cup of coffee without problems.

Also, if we try to make any more than 7 cups at a time we end up with grounds in our coffee.  The single cup is useless as well unless you want the smallest cup on earth. If you use enough grounds to make a decent size cup you will be drinking those grounds.  After several months of trying to make this work it is just going to end up in the landfill which is very sad.",1,2018-11-04,,True,,Brown water,,
4632,1,"It is amazing for the price. I really like the two options: single and carafe. Sometimes you just want to drink a solo cup and not brew an entire pot.

He uses the single brew  and I just end up using the carafe when he is done.",5,2016-11-08,,True,,Great price!,,

4634,1,"I love this coffee maker. I had a Keurig machine before this one, and I hardly used it. I got this one when I started to be at home more often and thought that a brewer that made a pot of coffee would be more useful. I use this far more often then I ever used the Keurig machine. I read the reviews before buying it and have found that as long as you make sure that you follow the guidelines about amounts of coffee to put in that the grounds don't overflow into the coffee. The coffeemaker is good at brewing regular strengths or the bold option is nice for when you want something stronger.",5,2014-03-06,2.0,True,,This is a great machine,,

4638,1,"I previously had a Cuisinart coffee brewer. I replaced it because 1) it was almost impossible to settle the carafe on the heating element, resulting in coffee spilling on the counter; 2) it was difficult pouring water into the small opening; 3) it was hard to judge how much water had been poured because the indicator was inside of the Cuisinart; 4) even though the coffee maker could take 10 cups of water, it could only handle grounds for six cups without making a mess; and 5) placing the opening for the water and the coffee grounds next to each other meant that I often spilled grounds into the water. The Hamilton Beach has none of these problems. Also, it is nice to be able to brew one cup of coffee at a time. Finally, and most important, I think that the coffee tastes better.",5,2016-09-30,5.0,True,,it is nice to be able to brew one cup of coffee ...,,

4641,1,"After 2 weeks I can say that it's ok for now. Will updated later. But right now the letters on the program button wore off after 2 weeks of light use.

I received a new one two days after I reported it. I think if you keep your packaging until you are satisfied with the unit.<br /><br /> Finally, you can't buy the pods for the single cup brewer from the store. You have to get them online. You can, however, use regular ground coffee in the same small basket for single cups. That works just fine. The pods are very convenient and easy to use.<br /><br />And oh, by the way, you need to buy the little gold metal basket that goes in the big carafe side to put your coffee in  for brewing.

4649,1,"I think the last time I purchased a new coffeemaker was sometime in the 1980s -- one of those old, plastic, white Mr. Coffee basic models everyone had. Since then I've used freebie coffeemakers from Gevalia. When the burner on this last one started to wear down, exposing whatever was underneath, I knew it was time to get a new one. But Gevalia doesn't offer the freebies anymore, so I looked online.<br /><br />I found this beauty, read the reviews, but kept it on my Wish List here on Amazon for a while. I balked at the price, having never paid that much for a coffeemaker before. Then, just after Christmas, I bit the bullet and bought it.<br /><br />Let me just say it does everything it says it's going to do, and I'm completely pleased with it. The &#34;bold&#34; brewing option means I can use a lot less coffee. I initially discovered I can't even use the regular setting and the same amount of coffee as my old coffeemaker, or it ended up way too strong. I cut back on the amount I used drastically and finally found a sweet spot that was similar to what I was used to. I'm now scaling back even more with the &#34;bold&#34; brewing option. Totally awesome. Plus, this one uses the cheapest (basket) coffee filters out there. After having to use the V-cone filters for the past umpteen years, I'm happy to go back to the inexpensive ones.<br /><br />I own a bunch of travel mugs, but the one that came with this coffeemaker does a great job keeping the coffee hot for a long time. (And the hole on top means you can brew right into it with the lid already on -- which helps keep it hot if I forget to retrieve the mug as soon as the coffee is brewed.) And, unlike other travel-mug-sized coffee brewers I've used in my home office, this one seems to give you almost as much coffee as the amount of water you started with. (All my previous ones left several *ounces* of water behind soaking in the grounds and filter.)<br /><br />The only thing I have to remember that is new to me is this: If I set the timer for it to brew later, I MUST remember to make sure the Single/Carafe switch is in the right position. One of the first days I had it, I had set the timer for morning, put in the grounds and water on the carafe side, but had forgotten to move the switch from the Single side to the Carafe side. I awoke in the morning to find nothing had happened. My mistake, of course, but I was at least grateful it didn't try to run the carafe side and turn on the burner without any water in it!<br /><br />No buyer's remorse here at all. It's a gorgeous machine and it works great!",5,2014-02-22,,True,,I love this coffeemaker!,,
4650,1,"Love the individual cup AND the carafe options. I can use ground coffee, pods, or even tea bags on both sides.

4653,1,My husband and I love this coffee maker.  He can't stop saying that we have bought the perfect coffee maker. He drinks regular coffee while I drink decaf.

4654,1,I love this coffee pot! The option to make a whole pot or just cup is what sold me on it.

This is not acceptable for a new coffee maker! I can only imagine how much slower it would be if there were coffee grounds for it to brew.

Also, the pot has a ridge beneath the plastic ring around it that blocks all of the coffee being poured out of the pot, which is annoying. There’s a little bit of water, which needs to be emptied when youu clean the pot and it’s not convenient. The one cup maker - my wife tried 2-3 times and didn’t like. Coffee didn’t brew the same. Otherwise, it was just ok while it worked. If making less then a full pot, the grounds didn’t always get completely wet- some dry around sides.

I bought the permanent gold filter with it to try out but I actually prefer the taste from the paper filters as it seems bolder. All in all I'm impressed, it was well worth the sale price of $55. My last coffee maker was a cheap Black and Decker and it made terrible coffee. I'm very happy with the upgrade!<br /><br />P.S. As with most coffee makers containing plastic parts, initially there can be a plastic smell or taste to the coffee.

4733,1,Bought this after reading previous reviews and we thought it would be what we needed.  Coffee maker is inconsistent in its output now.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  Tried to return but we missed the cut off by one day.  Thank you Amazon for your superior customer service and return policy (read sarcasm).  Going to have to rethink my buying options from now on.,2,2015-08-04,,True,,Does not work properly,,

I received the item today and it does NOT include the travel mug (when I purchased this exact item for my parents it did), otherwise all is well. Looking forward to using it and adding to my review.",5,2016-11-30,,True,,Excited!,,
4740,1,"Ok, I don't drink coffee, but my husband does and I got him this for his birthday.  He had one of the coffee makers that uses the small plastic cups, but he wasn't impressed by the flavor or that it only made a small cup.  So, he used to use a manual drip coffee maker but could only make one cup at a time, so if we had company, that wasn't very efficient.  This is the best of both worlds.  He loves that he can easily use his fresh ground coffee, and it has a small basket so that a paper filter isn't needed.  He says that there are no grounds at all in the coffee. There is also an insert that can be placed on the single serve side so that you can use your own cup.  He has been really pleased with both sides of the maker and it really works well for him.",5,2014-01-26,,True,,Great coffee maker!,,
4741,1,"I have been using a keurig for years and the pods were just getting to be too expensive. Plus I missed the freshness and variety of coffee grounds. I was not willing to give up my single serve option so this brewer was the perfect solution. Though it does take a little longer to brew a single cup, it's worth the wait. So far, I am loving this brewer.",4,2016-09-24,2.0,True,,Perfect solution,,
4742,1,"I was going to give this only 4 stars but the only real gripe i have with this (so far, after about 4 weeks of use) is that it doesn't use the cone-shaped filters (which seems silly now that I'm typing it out). I love the single-cup brew side, it brews quickly and quietly. I haven't yet used the scheduled brew feature, but based on everything else, I'm sure it works.",5,2017-02-03,,True,,Does what I need a coffee maker to do,,
4743,1,"Great coffee maker! I bought this to replace my old Mr. Coffee.  I wanted something that would make a single a cup when I didn't want a full pot.  This is great.

4745,1,"Just received today.  Washed everything in the dishwasher (as per the instructions) and made my first cup of coffee.  This coffee maker works as advertised and is capable of making excellent coffee if you follow the directions and use good beans (or ready-ground coffee) to start with.  It doesn't hurt that it looks nice and is modestly priced, especially when compared to the other, more expensive machines (I purchased this to replace one of those).  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.",5,2015-12-27,,True,,"Good price, excellent machine (and coffee, too!!)",,
4746,1,"This is a terrific coffee pot. It has the advantage of making a single cup or a full pot. At our house 90% of the use is the single cup. I was a little bit reluctant to buy this because of reviews that indicated that it didn’t last, but so far I think we were among the lucky ones that have had no problem whatsoever.",5,2018-08-07,,True,,Excellent design,,
4747,1,This item exceeds my expectations! This makes a very good cup of coffee. A lot of times we just want one or two cups of coffee. This way we don't have to waste any. It brews fast! Not hard to clean. The only problem I have is the only place I have been able to find the pods is on line. And they are expensive. I am trying to get my local Kroger store to carry them. But with this brewer we can also use the coffee grounds witch is a plus.<br />All in all we are very happy with this coffee maker!!,4,2015-12-28,,True,,Makes a very good cup of coffee!,,
4748,1,"This is a terrific coffeemaker. It's nice to have a choice between a cup or pot of coffee; the coffee comes out piping hot, and the hot plate keeps the pot nice and steamy.

4772,1,It makes coffee. I like the option that I can make a single cup of coffee as well. I'm glad I got it on a sale price because at full price of $79 it's just your basic coffee machine other than the fact that it can Brew single cup. What I don't like is that you cannot program it to shut off after it finishes Brewing say like in 5 minutes. It shuts off automatically after 2 hours that's too long to leave the coffee on and if you forget to turn it off when it's done Brewing your coffee is cooking for 2 hours. My other machine also when done Brewing had a little chime that notified you of such.

I tried less grinds, packing them down, scolding them, they just dont listen!! So your getting a coffee maker BECAUSE it has an independent to go maker, but the to go maker doesn't work. Not that it matters anymore, but the to go cup is cheap and crappy. Oh and the clock doesnt tell time.
