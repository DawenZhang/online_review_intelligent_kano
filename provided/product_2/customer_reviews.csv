Thirdly although you can program three different serving sizes the 2 larges sizes put out servings that are dilute-i.e. more water with the same K-cup.I didn't buy the newest Keurig due to the relatively large numbers of negative reviews. This one works but it's been cheapened down to save pennies and I can't see the benefit of three serving sizes if your coffee,etc is diluted out. I'm going to have to look elsewhere.

500,1,"When our original Keurig finally died a couple of weeks ago, we decided to purchase the &#34;new and improved&#34; 2.0 version.  MISTAKE.  The only thing the new version (new since 2015) provides is Keurig's ability to control our coffee buying habits.  Okay... We could live with purchasing Keurig endorsed pods, but we weren't prepared for all the other constraints (limitations) the 2.0 imposed.  We couldn't use our old fillable pods? Okay.  And the brew took longer? Oh, my!  And error messages popped up from the get-go? Yikes!  And, sure, we could now brew 16-oz mug-sizes, but we had to use the bigger pod for that? No one told us!  And the carafe was the authorized carafe that triggered a lever and used the larger Keurig pod?  Kaching! But that sound was in the pocket of Keurig, not MY pocket.  What was there to like?  NOT MUCH.  Make that, NOT ANYTHING.  We returned the &#34;new and improved,&#34; and we bought the K55 &#34;Classic.&#34;  Yes, what was once metal is now plastic, so handle it with more care than you handled the older, more rugged equivalent.  And do what we failed to do:  Save your old model and salvage parts from it when necessary.  Oh!  And save the filter insert because the &#34;Classic&#34; does not come with the insert for holding the filter itself.  Truth-be-told, though, you probably don't need that filter.  Finally, if you have the older version, cherish it and descale regularly to prolong its life.  Keurig is downhill after that... but you can prolong the descent by purchasing the K55 and holding on for dear life.",5,2016-05-07,8.0,,,Hold on for Dear Life,Color: Black,

I love that there are more options than just coffee like cappuccino or tea that can also be made in this and if I buy the reusable filter then I can use what's left of my coffee that was used with my previous coffee maker. So far the one and only thing I have a problem with is that when you add water and it sucks it in to the maker it doesn't use all the water so if you're just making one cup you end up having to throw away water because in the guide it says to dump the remaining water out which is wasteful when you are using bottled water or distilled water like I am.",4,2017-05-09,3.0,,,Love it!,Color: Black,

Our first purchase for a replacement was the Keurig K575, which is the fancy model with the view screen and the '2.0' designation.  We were concerned about that model because we weren't sure if our K-Cups were 2.0 compatible. We never found out. It powered up OK, but after that nothing worked so we had to return it to the local store from whence it came. They told us they get a lot of those back and recommended the simple K55. This model is much like our original. It doesn't seem to be a 2.0 design as it so far as accepted every K-Cup we've put inside. It works much like the original model did with the three brew size buttons that turn blue when it's hot and ready to brew. The tank is a bit smaller than the original, but since fresh water is key to good coffee, that doesn't both us much as we usually only drink 2 cups each morning (1 per person).

648,1,"I was tired of cleaning out my Cuisinart coffee maker every day and after visitng a friend who had a Keurig, decided to order one. Fortunatelty, I didn't throw out the old coffeemaker. At first I was delighted with the convenience and thought that I would just use up the K-cups which came with my purchase and then move onto the more enviornmentally friendly reusable cups where I tried our favorite coffee, but it was very weak. Then I tried some frreshly ground espresso but got mud in the bottom of the cup. I then ordered the paper filters which helped keep out the grounds, but the coffee just wasn't good. I settled on using Lavazzo Perfetto K-cups which are the best of the lot as far as I'm concerned, but they still don't make a decent cup of coffee. The problem is in the process....the water shoots through a little cup in record time and never actually brews anything. By the end of that cup, you are just getting water. I'm giving this away and taking out my old coffeemaker. The Keurig isn't expensive but the K-cups are and the whole system just doesn't work very well.",2,2016-10-19,2.0,True,,Not worth it.,Color: Black,

It makes the warming up noise, then it makes a sound like it is trying to suck up or pump the water for a second, then it stops  and does nothing.  I am so discouraged.  This was a lot of money for it to last no longer than it worked.  I ordered it on Black Friday.  I am the only coffee drinker in the house so it was not used heavily.  I read almost the same thing on another review.  If the seller makes this right, I will update my review.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />Later figured out how to fix it by watching YouTube videos! I took it apart and saw that there was black discoloration in the clear tube which brings water into the k cup. I took a 10 cc syringe and pushed water into the hole water comes out to flush all the coffee grounds out. I now do this maybe once a month and run water through it especially if I stop my cup from brewing early.

763,1,"I have the machine for about 4 years. I normally drink brewed coffee in medium roast. I find Keurig machines in general do not make coffee strong enough. I have tried various models and different level of roast and flavors available on the market. So I don't use the machine often. A year ago when a friend tried to make a cup of coffee, the machine stopped working, no water coming out after all that noise of heating and pumping. After a few resets, it started to work. Yesterday when I was trying to make a cup of coffee, the water would not come out of the spout. I went online and read and watched instructions and youtube videos to clean the machine and still no luck. The hot water was coming of the back and pouring into the cold water reservoir. An hour later I was about to toss the machine in the trash. I saw one youtube video which shows how to take top of the plastic cover off to expose the tubes and pumping mechanism, and squeeze the junction part of the tube. I was able to get the machine to work again.<br />Overall, Keurig is not for me. it does not make a good cup of coffee and too fancy to maintain for occasional use.",2,2016-12-31,,,,Not worth the money for the convenience,Color: Black,

Now there was nothing wrong with my original, I had had it for 6+ years but it was shorting the circuit so I got nervous. Turns out it wasn't the machine. Now I am in search of the original design because what we always seem to find out is that the original is usually the best. Now on to my review....<br /><br />This machine is going to be the death of me. It takes 45 minutes to brew a full cup of coffee. For some reason it is stuck on stupid and brews a tiny teacup at a time and it takes 6 minutes in between to process the second cup. Every morning I start the machine before I even shower because it takes that long and if I stand there and wait for it I get visions of beating the crap out of it with a baseball bat or throwing it out to the birds. Do not buy this model, I am not the only one who has had the same problems.

It wasn’t heating the water to the correct temperature and all the coffee tasted bitter.  I was very disappointed that it lasted such a short time.

You don’t have to refill the reservoir every time you brew, which is a huge plus. It stands about 3 inches taller than my last model (it’s 13.5” tall) but still fits quite comfortably underneath my cabinet and is just as easy to use. It makes a delicious cup every time.

Our coffee tastes couldn't be more opposite.  Before our Keurig, my husband would brew a pot of coffee in the morning so strong, it could practically peel paint off the walls, and I would use almost half a cup of creamer to make his gross coffee barely drinkable.  Arguments ensued.  We would race each other out of bed in the morning to be able to make the pot of coffee that way we liked it.  It wasn't pretty.

I would have to turn it off and unplug it and reset it, in order to be operational again. And the worst part is, the part where you put it in the pods and has that sharp, piercing metal BROKE. At first, it bended and after that it completely fell off it's base. So how am I suppose to brew my coffee?!! We've been piercing the K Cups just so the hot water can get into it and brew some damn coffee. I don't even know where to get a replacement part for it. Has the Keurig quality gone down the dumps?

My beef with this one is it turns off frequently, so when you want to brew you have to turn on and wait for it to pump the water into the heating chamber before you can even start the process.  You have to wait until the water is in there and heated before putting a K-cup in the holder or else the buttons don't acknowledge that you're ready to brew.  If you put the K-cup in there too soon (before the buttons are lit) you will have to reopen the handle so it triggers.  Basically it trains you to wait and do things it's own way.

I had to warm up my milk and sometimes the whole cup in order to get a hot cup of coffee.  Plus, if you have company it's not good to be making one cup at a time.

I enjoy the large reservoir that keeps me from needing to fill it up with every single use.  It's also grand that there are three cup size options to tailor to the size of your mug and your coffee preferences.  An additional perk is that in addition to the k-cup coffees, this machine will also accommodate other various brands, as well as reusable pods.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to give it 5-stars though, I had to dock one for one minor flaw:  even though there is a drip-tray, sometimes the stream of brewed coffee is a bit over enthusiastic and so I notice little splashes of coffee droplets after we've brewed our morning cups (we have white tiled counter-tops so the coffee splatters are quite noticeable.

The first one I got stopped working after 2 1/2 cups of coffee.  No water pressure and then wouldn’t pump water at all.  Asked for a replacement and it came very quickly. The new one still does not seem to have pressure.  Seems to work fine with no K-cup but on a large coupe especially it starts strong and then just dribbles our.

1089,1,"This ""new classic"" Keurig K55 is a huge disappointment. I owned and loved a Keurig B-60 for nearly 10 years, until the pump finally died. The K55 seemed a reasonable replacement - it looks similar, has most of the same features, and I don't need all the flexibility of the higher-end models. I do need a machine that makes coffee reliably, and after less than 4 months of owning the K55 I can say it does *not* do that.<br />When I unpacked the K55 my first thought was that it felt like a cheaply-made plastic knock-off of a Keurig. Yes, they're all plastic, but this one feels thin and flimsy. It seemed to work well enough for the first month or so, then I started having trouble with the first cup in the morning. It seemed to struggle to pump water, and made very unusual noises when filling, heating, and brewing. The first cup was usually just a couple of ounces, not even a small one. Sometimes it wouldn't make the second cup at all. After a while I started unplugging it and plugging it back in after the first cup. That helped sometimes, other times it still struggled. In the last few weeks I've had to resort to shaking and banging on the side to make it pump water. Today was the last straw - I had to take the machine over to the sink, turn it over and shake it to make some of the water come out, and start all over. I know these tactics will not extend its useful life, but I gotta have the coffee...<br />The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that when it does finally decide to make a cup of coffee, the quality is exactly what I expect from a Keurig.

I enjoy a cup in the mornings, but never took the time to program my regular pot to make the coffee. Even when I did, I had a hard time getting the strength right. And then, of course, you have to wash the basket and the carafe......just too much trouble for this busy girl. Work took me to our downtown office where there are Keurigs all over the place, different models too. I think that was what changed my mind, after a few weeks. It was so convenient, fast, and clean. So when I got Mother's Day Amazon gift cards, I decided to treat myself to a little hoity-toity. I had decided I liked this model, due to the reservoir and the cup sized choices. I bought some plain ole Folgers Classic K-cups, that were on sale. Got the machine the day after I ordered it, thank-you Amazon.<br /><br />I love that you can use a travel mug. My favorite one holds exactly 2 cups. I used one K-cup, and set it for the 8 oz. size, lifted the lid, put it back down and chose the 6 oz. size. This left a little bit of room to add my favorite creamer, when I don't want black coffee. Yes, I used the same K-cup! The coffee was delicious. No plastic taste or anything, like I've read in some of the reviews. I use filtered water from my Brita pitcher and I also put the filter in the reservoir, that came with the machine. Maybe that helped. I don't know. The coffee is also very hot, even after I add my cold creamer. The first day, I just had it black and the first sip burned my tongue! Much hotter than a drip machine, but I like it, because my coffee is still hot when I get to work. I'm so happy that I got this and can have a cup in the mornings with no fuss, no muss and very little time.<br /><br />I also researched many other brands, hoping to spend less money.

We exchanged this machine thinking it was just a faulty machine, however, the second machine ended up only filling up the cup with about 1/8 a cup of coffee. The coffee would also trickle out very slowly, one drop at time. After trying to brew 4 or 5 cups once I discovered the coffee maker wasn't working correctly, the Keurig would no longer produce any liquids. The Keurig is incredibly convenient and I was so excited to have one in the house, however, we ended up switching to a non-Keurig that still takes K-cups and its much better than the Keurig (although still not great). On top of all this, the Keurig's largest option for cup size still did not fill up my travel mug all the way and I don't believe there is a way to program it like other coffee makers. I could be wrong on that because I haven't looked into it, however this is not a smart purchase. For a almost hundred dollar coffee maker, I expected to be much more satisfied.

Much to my disappointment, when we brew our cups, the coffee is extremely weak, like tea almost, and has no flavor.  After brewing a number of cups like this, I opened one of the used K Cups only to find that the grounds were very dry, barely wet.  It's as if the water this machine pushes through the K cups goes straight through without properly and thoroughly soaking the coffee grounds.  Coffee grounds need to soak a bit in the water, hence why your basic coffee machines percolate or drip the coffee to ensure a slow soaking process to get a good flavorful cup of coffee.

I have been using a Single Serve coffee maker with a reusable basket for the last few years, and my biggest complaint was, the flavored coffees, to a degree, lost their special aroma and flavor after just a few days in the bag. I tried different types of storage, but with the same result. Also, the coffee could, in my opinion, be hotter. My first cup of coffee with my new Keurig was Mudslide from Gloria Jeans Coffees. I was blown away! The flavor, the temperature of the coffee after brewing was fantastic. And I brewed this cup at the 10-ounce setting. Since then, I have tried Lattes from Gevalia, Mocha from StarBucks, hot chocolate and I have also used a reusable K-cup with my own beans, Chocolate Cherry from Cameron Brothers. I will definitely recommend this product to others! Now, if they would please start making biodegradable K-Cups!",5,2016-06-22,,True,,Best cup of coffee ever!,Color: Black,
1588,1,"This was a present to me and I couldn't be happier. I've had zero issues with this brewer, making 2-3 cups of coffee daily. Refillable k-cups brew perfectly, so do any disposable k-cup drinks I brew. This model doesn't have the sensor for 'real' kcups which is one of the reasons I chose it. I do wish the water reservoir was a little bigger, but it's not really that big of a deal having to refill it every other day. It sure beats making a pot of drip coffee every morning. I also loved my 4-cup sample pack. 3 coffees and 1 hot chocolate. :) I'm very pleased with this brewer, and I don't have issues with my coffee splattering on the machine like I see some people having.

I WANT A NEW VERSION! But family wont go for it because this one still works fine. No problems as of yet. We've cleaned the inside with things like vinegar, some kit wife bought, etc. Prob used thousands of k cups by now.<br /><br />I'm starting to worry about the used pods too. Are they bad for the environment?? Are they filling up landfills?? I know just our house alone contributed thousands of the used k cups so I cont imagin the math when you factor in the entire planet!<br /><br />Anyway, if it's NOT hurting the enviro, I want a new one! So I thought I'd try this. Leave the review of it from our home, how well it has actually been working and how great coffee is. The Keurig is so much more convenient than the past 50 years of the old way, coffee getting cold, wasted, sitting in a pot for hrs, always cleaning the pot, ughhh. After we bought a Keurig way back then, I knew right away I'd never go back to the old way!

We visit each other often and sit around discussing world events. Unlike some other reviewers, we found the quality and variety of K cups excellent. So, here it is over a year later and every one of these machines is DEAD. Went through the maintenance routines with customer service, reviewed all the YouTube videos, etc. Nothing good. Keurig basically told us that we are SOL because we didn't maintain them. That is BS as we followed maintenance procedures religiously (two of us are retired engineers). We are back to microwaving instant coffee or using our old Mr. Coffee. Thanks Keurig for nothing.<br />MY SECOND REVIEW<br />After my first review of Keurig coffee makers, a friend bought me another. These are great ! You must have done something wrong ! After approximately 20 brewed cups of very good coffee, my new one is having issues. I either get a half or two thirds a cup of coffee. I give up. I love the quality of the coffee, but have concluded Keurig coffee just isn't worth it. This machine just isn't worth it to me, considering the cost of the K cups and the continued hassle of the maintenance.

I have continued to use it for a month without any problems whatsoever.  However, I need to learn how to re-prime the water pump after I have removed and replaced the reservoir during the cleaning process.<br /><br />Original comment:  I purchased this Keurig coffee brewer on June 28, 2017.  It stopped working on September 13, 2017.  One day before it worked fine.  The water is not transferring from the water reservoir to the brewing chamber.  Furthermore, I cannot reach Keurig customer service due to impacts from Hurricane Irma.  This is very disappointing.

1792,1,"This is by far the best Keurig. We had previously bought a K475 or a K575 and it was terrible. The touch screen would sometimes work. It was very loud and it would take at least 5 minutes to heat up to start brewing and then once it did heat up, since the screen rarely worked I could press the cup size to brew. And I had only owned it for less than 24hrs. But the K55 Keurig is simple, works great, its not loud. And I have coffee in less than a minute. My parents have had theirs for over 4yrs and it still looks and works like its brand new. Plus the tray at the bottom is removable so you can fit tumblers.

This is really annoying when you have dispensed several cups and it is apparent there is not enough water in the canister to fill another cup.  You have to start the filling process first, wait for the &#34;add water&#34; light to come on and then refill the water in the canister for the machine to work properly.

One pod and the 8 oz of water is way too weak for me.The pods are expensive.  I did buy reusable filters so I can use my own coffee and save money. But that is messy since you have to wash out the filters after each use, Also the coffee is weak and has residue. What a hassle. This is way more work to get a decent cup of coffee than my old $15 small coffee machine from the drugstore.<br />Also you can use your large cups if you remove the tray. My kids like using the hot chocolate pod, so once in awhile they will use that.  I am the only one who drinks coffee. I would return this but I waited too long. It is 90 days now. I have tried everything, multiple brands of pods, using my own favorite coffee, different filters. I think the fact the water is not very hot and goes through the coffee in seconds, will not get the flavor I ever want. 100 bucks down the drain. This is not even that convenient. You have to refill the water after just a few cups or it will not brew for you. Update- I went to Reddit to see if anyone could recommend a good coffee that had a stronger flavor and they recommended found Peets Major Dickerson blend , or death wish coffee, which I have not tried yet. Also I discovered you can brew  these coffee pods twice. That made a difference. I brew the Peets Major Dickerson blend twice on the 6 oz and get one good strong cup out of it.  Then I brewed the medium french roast blend I bought twice on the lowest water oz, 4 oz and got a decent cup out of that Try it.<br />Water still cools off quite fast and other people said that is just how these are. Suggestions were made to heat your cream and cup up first. I bought this for convenience, not more work.

2424,1,"This is my very first review that will list pros and cons. Those of you who are avid coffee drinkers, like me, might be interested in what I am about to say. The above model was purchased to replace Keurig's original B60 which I had for a little over 15 yrs. As you know Keurig was the first manufactuer to introduce convenience for us coffee fanatics. The B60 at the time sold for the same price ($150) no matter where purchased, it was a strong built machine, simple operation, never quiet., and still working when I decided to give it a rest for the many good yrs of service. A few yrs ago the B60 sounded as if heavy trucks started their engines, in a closed environment, at the same time, but the machine kept going, producing hot coffee in less time than the Classic, meaning didn't have to wait the few seconds for water to reheat, you could just keep filling coffee cups one after another. Other companies joined the convenience era introducing their versions which made Keurig produce more models, some with fancy features. However, in my opinion, Keurig's mass production to keep up with the competition resulted in poor quality control. I spent time reading reviews from different sites, have friends who purchased more than one of the newer models,  (some up to 3, in a short period of time)  for lack of performance or some kind of problem. I took a chance on the above Classic model because I don't need extra features and the cost was a good deal. If the machine last a yr I won't be too disappointed, I'm convinced it will never last as long as the B60, I have yet to read a review of newer Keurig models lasting that long. Wish I understood why Keurig discontinued a great model. The classic is light weight, cheaply made. The handle is some form of plastic, B60 was heavy duty thick stainless steel handle, the water cover was heavier. The classic is all plastic, including the drip plate. I made a cup of coffee and being used to loud banging sounds, I didn't know it was working so I  watched the Classic brew, it is a quiet machine and it was a pleasure not to hear sounds as if the machine was going to explode. Using the smaller size cup 3X, the button for ""add water"" comes on.  Never had that experience with the B60, nor did a light come on after each cup to heat the water. With the B60 you could make cup after cup, always hot, without waiting, until you notice the machine needs water. I also don't think this produces the coffee hot enough. Right now, the only feature I like about the Classic is that it's quiet. As I said, if it last a year or 2 fine, if not I'll buy a different model. I don't think a different model with a higher price is going to make much difference. Keurig is mass producing and they have yet to answer any of my concerns inquiring into the newer models. There are a lot of updates, modern features to all kinds of appliances we once owned. I'm all for that, I wasn't looking for a replacement, just a good, strong, simple operating machine to produce coffee whenever I want at a hot temperature.  The B60 came with a booklet that contained several pages, including outlining the descaling process. I'll admit it was inconvenient having to wait 4 hrs after running the machine through with vinegar, especially for someone born and raised in Brooklyn who's family past time was drinking coffee!. From what I  learned about all the Keurig models out there, none will ever last as long as my B60. Maybe someday Keurig will bring it back as an anniversary promotion.",3,2018-12-15,,True,,Keurig K-Classic,Color: Black,

We use 16 oz Klean Kanteen insulated containers, which are about 7.25&#34; tall without the lid, and they do not fit the K55 because the distance between the spout and the cup base (with the water catch reservoir removed) is about 7&#34;.

2556,1,"Pros: Cup of coffee in seconds. You can buy kcups for as little as $0.30 and as high as $1. This basically saves you the trip to your local starbucks. Your pike costs around $3 at starbucks, and if you drink every day, you save over $900 in coffee every year (that's if you drink hot coffee in the summer). You can also make tea as well by taking out the pods and just allowing hot water to pour instead.<br /><br />Cons: The 3 settings are pretty much misleading. The first few ounces it pours is a majority of the coffee and the rest is diluted coffee. With the 3 setting sizes, you have strength of the coffee being high with the smallest cup and the lowest with the largest cup. The smallest cup is around 4oz and the largest is close to 10oz. The middle one varies on my end but it is close to 7oz. Since you're making only hot coffee, there's no chance of actually making a decent cold brew even after extracting and refrigerating. The 3 sizes is small and you do wish to make larger pots however, that requires multiple pods and multiple redos.",4,2018-01-06,,True,,Good cup of joe for a single serve mug,Color: Black,

2582,1,"TL:DR- I love this coffee maker. This is my 1st coffee maker and when (or if) it breaks I plan to buy another!<br /><br />I used to spend a lot of money on coffee. This was almost exclusively bought at Starbucks. The only time I'd drink coffee-machine or homebrewed coffee is at friends' houses and I thought nothing of it.  After another year of doing taxes, finances, and trying to trim my expenses, I noticed that purchasing Starbucks coffee 4-6 times a week was quite an expense.  I cut coffee for a few months and then I noticed this item on sale for Prime Amazon members.  After searching through the reviews and questions, I went for it and bought it.  This thing is amazing. At only the click of a button, within a minute you have 1 (or more) mugs of delicious coffee.  Initially I bought a mixture of 30+ different k-cups, but after trying many of them I have found my favorites.  Instead of spending $25-35 per week and upwards of $1800 per year on coffee I can buy the k-cups en mass for super cheap at under 1$ per mug (and each cup can be nearly 2 mugs if the lady wants some coffee as well).<br />If you like coffee but are tired of the high cost of coffee shops, I strongly recommend checking out this coffee maker.",5,2016-11-17,,True,,DR- I love this coffee maker,Color: Black,

I called the Keurig hotline and they had me poking it with a paperclip and running plain water through it to get it to work again.  The hotline told me I had to do this every 2 weeks.

The quality is NOT what it used to be. It just feels cheap if I can be totally honest. The finish on the handle as well as the keureg logo looks very cheap and the plastics all feel thin and flimsy. Also, you hage to put down a towel in front and around it kat so all the splashes don't make a big mess. Our original unit NEVER made a mess like that and felt solid and felt like high quality paint and materials were used.<br /><br />It's too bad to see that a product that was so well built 10 years ago started using cheaper materials. You'd think more success and publicity of these over the years would've helped them make them even better - but it seems to be the other way around unfortunately.<br /><br />Needless to say, I will not be purchasing any more keureg products after this. Now that home espresso machines are getting so much more affordable I'll be buying one of those next.

If you want a 12 oz. cup, do 2 six oz. brews; if you want 14 oz., do a 6 and an 8. Another thing--just like tea becomes stronger the longer it steeps, coffee does too.

The unit detects excessive back pressure and stops.  All one needs to do is get a paper clip and open up for one piece of wire to insert on either side of the needle to remove and debris.

Actually, i usually skip the middle-man and stick my head directly under the spout and let it pour directly into my mouth.

That unit lasted just under two years before the pump died.  Messing about to get a pump replacement seemed prohibitive in effort if not in money, so I decided a new machine was in order.  I considered carefully whether to get another Keurig.  Ultimately, I decided the benefits did not outweigh the costs, and felt it should have lasted longer.  Single user for under two years, making about one cup per day (and running the recommended maintenance cleanings) didn't seem like significant use.  So I bought a Krupps cone drip and never looked back.<br /><br />A year or so later, I was faced with a coffee challenge at my office.  I am particular about quality/roast of coffee and  what is available there didn't suit me.  After fussing about with my own assortment of pots there, I tired of maintaining another coffeepot at the office, where my day already is full of work responsibilities.  I decided perhaps a Keurig would be a good alternative, despite its costs, and purchased this model and put it on my desk.<br /><br />It lasted about three months.  Counting the approximate number of cups it made before its pump died, it came to somewhere around 100 cups of coffee.  I don't have time to deal with shipping/sending/mucking about with warranties, etc.  So into the rubbish bin it goes, and I will never bother with this company again.<br /><br />If you haven't used a machine like this, I'll just say when they work, it is so very nice.  It's a lot like a Star Trek replicator.  A seemingly instant cup of coffee appears after sitting a K-cup in the machine and pressing a button.  However, given that they don't seem well made, even at under $100, you may also decide it's not worth it.  Additionally, the price per cup is significantly higher than if you brewed coffee by any other means, because of the cost of packaging.  For those concerned about creating too much trash, there also is that.  And yes, you can purchase a reuseable 'cup' that you fill yourself; however, the amount of coffee you use in that is nearly twice what you would use for a single cup of coffee in a regular coffeemaker, else the cup will be very weak.  So you're still spending more per cup.<br /><br />Unless someday they decide to put more quality and longevity into the product, I am done with Keurig, sadly.",1,2018-10-06,2.0,True,,Disposable Coffeemaker,Color: Black,

I see that other reviewers have also reported the same problem.  My first Keurig lasted about 4 years, and I was fine replacing it at that point, but less than three months is ridiculous.  Up until it died suddenly this morning, it worked fairly well, although sometimes it would not brew as much coffee as it should for the cups level chosen.  Even so, it didn't bother me too much.

There were so many different machines, two different &#34;versions&#34;, which made it difficult to choose.<br /><br />I finally got the machine (which I ordered with two different sets of coffee pods.  The coffee was brilliant from the very first.  (ok, not a real fan of the flavored coffees, but the dark roast types all seem excellent)<br /><br />Then, a miracle happened.  I registered my machine with Keurig, and they made an offer for a large percentage off on up to 5 sets of 24 pods.  I got a number of more traditional coffee makers (Star Bucks, Tulleys, etc).  These are even better, so I tend to limit myself to one &#34;special&#34; coffee a day for now.<br /><br />I am very please with my purchase.  It was inexpensive, makes great coffee, is fast, quiet, clean, and easy to use.  It is truly everything I was looking for in a single serve coffee maker.  While some people may consider the water tank too small, I only tend to fill mine once a day, which seems perfect to me.<br /><br />Pros - Great Coffee, low cost of ownership, a variety of pods that have good to great coffee, nice style, easy to use, power cut off, large enough water tank.<br /><br />Cons - Ok, to be fair, I may be drinking a bit more coffee now.

Some notified Keurig and were given another coffeemaker.  I called and was told that there is no safety issue (which was my concern) with the Keurig and it was not necessary to replace unit.

3451,1,"Waited a while before reviewing our Keurig.  Love the ability to make just one cup at a time.  Coffee is always fresh, and there are tons of different varieties to choose from.  So far it has only given a us a few minor glitches.  Twice the needle has become plugged which doesn't allow the water to flow out properly causing it to not work at all.  It states to always run one setting of just hot water thru after making a hot chocolate, cappuccino, or other thick drinks to prevent clogged needles.  Which we always do, but even then have had it clog when just coffee is used.  Easy to fix with use of a paper clip to unclog the needle.  The biggest gripe is the inconsistency of the amounts measured per cup.  There are three settings that allow you to choose how much water you want for desired drink, which lets you determine the strength of your coffee, tea, or what ever your drinking.  At times the small setting will not be so small and the medium is either direction at times.  It has overflowed a standard coffee cup twice.  If it wasn't for this little issue I'd give it 5 stars.

At high altitude you do have to push the k cup down onto the needle manually until you here the pop of the needle because the unit doesn't have enough pressure to push through the expanded k cup at high altitude.

The coffee maker is used to make about 3-4 cups a week, which is hardly abusing the machine. They just seem to break down at the same time around the 18 month period regardless of how much or how little it was used. It's worth buying an extended warranty. After the first machine broke I bought a 3 year extended warranty and when the machine died this week I filed a claim where all I have to do is box up the machine and ship it back with the prepaid label and within 72 hours I will receive an Amazon e-gift card to buy anything I want, which of course will be another K-Cup coffee maker.

I also like that coffee is not the only thing this can be used for. I can brew a cup of tea or make a nice hot cup of hot chocolate! This is very useful! I personally don't think the size is too large on my counter top. Being able to purchase so many different flavor K-cups is nice so I can match my coffee to my mood or what I'm doing also that you can purchase a refillable K-cup to use other blends of coffee preferred not available in K-cups.

3539,1,"We have talked about getting a Keurig coffee maker for several years now.  When I saw this one on a special deal on Black Friday I went ahead and purchased it with my credit card points.  I was so excited when it arrived that I quickly opened it and set it up on the counter.  I am happy to say I brewed the first cup of hot chocolate from the sample pack that came with the machine.  I sure am glad it came with a few K-cups since I forgot to order some when I ordered the machine!  The machine is super easy to set up and brews super quick as well.  I absolutely love this machine.  I no longer have to brew an entire pot of coffee that is all the same.  I can quickly and easily brew a cup at a time and give everyone exactly what they want.<br /><br />This particular machine has three cup sizes from which to choose which is wonderful.  My husband loves a super strong coffee so he uses Sumatra coffee with the small cup setting.  His coffee is nice and bold every time.  I prefer flavored coffees and I usually use the medium cup setting.<br /><br />My machine also has a two hour auto shut off feature that you can set up which is wonderful.  We will never have to wonder if we left it on or not.  When you turn the Keurig K55 on it only takes a few seconds before it is ready to brew your favorite brew!  I also love that this model has a water reservoir so you don't have to add water each time you wish to brew a cup of coffee.<br /><br />There were four different colors from which to choose.  I chose black because it was the cheapest.  There was white, blue and red as well; however, the other colors were a lot more expensive then the black.<br /><br />I am so happy I purchased my new Keurig K55 coffee maker.  Now, when it comes to coffee and other hot beverages, everyone is happy all the time!",5,2016-12-05,3.0,True,,Happiness in a Cup,Color: Black,

So when using the refillable unit in the future, we realized that after filling it (but before using it), must clear the center area of coffee by sticking pinkie finger or something.

I use a combo of kcups + an eco friendly refillable kcup for specialty brews.  The new machine works great! No problems at all. The convenience remains awesome.

3699,1,I purchased a Keurig K55 single serve programmable coffee maker.  A really nice product.  I have owned several Keurigs and I like this one the best because it has a water tank on the side that holds approximately 3 cups of water so you don't have to keep adding water every time you brew a cup of coffee.  I gave this a 4 star because they only last about 2 years at best.<br />UPDATE 8/16/17.  I had to return the the first K55 because it did not work properly.  Amazon sent me another one and I received it today.  Just set it up and ran it through a test run with just water.  So far so good.  I'm hoping I don;t have to return this one because I really like the Keurig coffee maker.  Its so easy to just pop in the K-cup of your choice and get a really good cup of hot coffee.<br /><br />REVISED 9/11/17:  I returned the first K55 and received a new one.  It worked great for about a month and now it's not working properly.  Only gives a few drips of coffee and it is not even warm. Something is wrong with the K-55 brewer.  I only had a few more days to return the coffee maker and made it just in time.  Will not purchase another K-55.  Tried calling the company but because of Hurricane Irma they are closed.

While they do produce a high quality cup of coffee,<br />I get a better cup by grinding whole beans of my choice into a standard two cup (advertised as 5 cup) cone drip coffee maker.<br />I bought this K55 for my X in San Diego, because other businesses in her office building were not making coffee, but using it, or<br />stealing her creamer in the building break area fridge (also got her a mini fridge). After working in many offices for over 40+ years,<br />I know this is normal, as lazy people will justify just about anything as long as they do not have to take responsibility.<br />She is very busy, grabs a cup in the morning at home, and then another at the office; this is her routine, and it works for her.<br />If you are like her, then this machine, and the cost may work for you.<br />If you are like me, and have the personal time (1 minute) to grind your own, then this is the best way to go, as you get better tasting, higher quality coffee at a fraction of the cost of using a K cup machine.  I payed 1/4 the price for my drip coffee maker, and get 5 pounds of great whole coffee beans for 30 to 40 bucks; Do you realize how long 5 pounds of coffee lasts?<br />All this aside, this machine works well (her home machine is a K55, and is three years old), and I hardly ever turn down a cup of coffee, no matter how it is made with the exception of the frothy, creamy, chocolate. air injected garbage that &#34;you know who&#34; produces at a totally ridiculous price.",3,2017-12-10,,True,,Not the best cup of coffee.,Color: Black,

3801,1,"I used to have a small, inexpensive, one-cup coffee maker. I loved it because it was lightweight, didn't take up a lot of counter space and worked fine. I used my own coffee and the only downside is it had to be filled with water for each cup.  *Not a big deal*  But I thought I'd keep up with the trend and get a Keurig.  What I like is that it has a decent reservoir for water and that I have the option to use a refillable pods.  Get the cheap refillable pods, like from Big Lots or online.  The Keurig refillable pod is not worth it, because you have to pop out the plastic insert holder that stays put for pre-made pods and it takes away from the convenience of the Keurig experience. I'm a one-cup-a-day person and the quantity of coffee that a pod holds makes each cup a little too weak for me; so instead I have to set it for the medium size cup level, which I think is only about 4 oz.<br />OK, so to sum up, the water reservoir is the only reason I like this Keurig.

These super automatic machines allow you to load whole bean coffee of your choice into a hopper and at the push of a button, it grinds the beans, loads them into the brew unit, dispenses the coffee, then dumps the used grounds and is ready to brew another cup at the touch of a button. They are completely adjustable so you can brew your coffee as strong as you like, from espresso to fairly weak American-style coffee. They also have a steamer which allows you to make cappuccino and other coffee beverages. I love these machines and they make great coffee, but they have disadvantages. First, because you have to load the whole beans in the hopper, it isn't easy to change to a different coffee if other family members drink decaf, for example, or prefer lighter or darker roasts. Also, they only brew coffees, no other beverages. Lastly, they are complicated and require quite a bit of maintenance.<br /><br />Enter the Keurig K55, which is their least expensive basic model but does everything I expect. I purchased it for my wife who likes to drink my lighter coffee as well as various teas, hot chocolate, cider, etc. My thought was to let her use the Keurig and to continue making my coffee in my Saeco but I've found that the Keurig makes very good coffee and suspect that my Saeco will be retired because the Keurig is so much more convenient to use and maintain and I'm completely satisfied with the coffee I'm brewing in it, perhaps not quite as &#34;great&#34; as that I make in my Saeco more than satisfactory, and far superior to the coffee I buy in restaurants, donut shops and convenience stores.<br /><br />I won't recommend particular k-cup coffee brands because there are so many of them and everyone has different preferences. One of the main advantages to the Keurig is that there are so many choices available, with three brew strength/ water level settings, as well as a great variety of other hot beverages such as black and herbal teas, hot chocolates, ciders, and more.<br /><br />You can also buy reusable k-cup holders and any ground coffee you like. This may save a little money and also allows you to choose your favorite coffee even if it isn't available in K-cups. I ordered a set of these reusable k-cups and have tried them with several ground coffees, comparing them to the prefilled k-cup versions of the same coffees. The k-cup ones are as good or better than the ones I've loaded myself using the reusable k-cups and are SO MUCH easier and more convenient to use. They're a little more expensive but still reasonably priced, particularly if you buy them in bulk from Amazon, Sam's Club, etc., or find them on sale at your local supermarket. On average, I'm paying less around 40 cents a pod for mine. Other k-cup beverages such as teas and hot chocolate tend to be less expensive than the premium coffees I buy.<br /><br />The real advantages to the Keurig are convenience, ease of use and the variety of coffees and beverages you can make with it, including iced teas and other iced beverages. My wife and I can share a single machine and make our own preferred beverages quickly and easily. After she makes a flavored beverage, I simply run a shot of hot water through the machine to remove any off-taste before brewing my coffee.<br /><br />Although I won't recommend specific brands due to personal tastes, I will mention that I prefer well-balanced, slightly acidic medium to medium dark roasts. I don't like breakfast blends or other light roasts, nor do I like really dark roasts such as those typical of some coffee shops such as Starbucks, although I have tried some of the dark roasts from Starbucks k-cups and others and they are fine, just not to my taste. I usually use the medium water level (7.25 oz) setting. Depending on the coffee I'm using, this usually gives me a rich, well-balanced, fairly strong cup of coffee. For some lighter roast coffees I prefer the low (5.25 oz) setting. My wife doesn't like strong coffee and usually uses the high (7.25 oz) setting. Teas, ciders and hot chocolate usually taste better with the high water level setting.<br /><br />If you are considering giving the Keurig a try, I recommend that you consider buying one of the many sampler k-cup packs available on Amazon. Some are coffee only and others include assorted flavored coffee, cappuccino, tea, hot chocolate, cider, etc. The one I bought is this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KSIE39I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 . It was a good choice and my wife and I quickly discovered our favorites. We've also bought a few others to try (on sale) at my local supermarket. All were good, even though some weren't to my personal taste. Once you decide on your favorites and the brew strength you prefer, you're all set to make good, fresh coffee and other k-cup beverages easily and conveniently.<br /><br />I mentioned at the beginning of my review that I'm not a &#34;coffee snob&#34; but I do insist on good fresh coffee, brewed to my personal taste. The Keurig accomplishes this. I realize that many people ARE purists (coffee snobs, in my parlance). If so, you probably won't like the Keurig but for 95% of all coffee drinkers, the Keurig is great. I'm more than willing to give up my &#34;perfect&#34; cup for one that's almost as good and so much easier and more convenient to brew, not to mention all of the other beverages it will make.<br /><br />I can see why the Keurig has become so popular. It fully deserves the five star rating I've given it. I highly recommend it to most coffee drinkers. I'm less convinced that it's the best solution to brew tea. It's okay but I still think it's worth the effort to brew tea by steeping it (using the Keurig to dispense hot water for brewing it if you wish). However, K-cup hot tea and iced teas aren't bad and are certainly quick and easy.",5,2016-12-11,2.0,True,,One Week With My Keurig K55. I Love It!,Color: Black,

I was previously using a French press to make my coffee in the mornings, but grew tired of how long it took to make my daily coffee and found myself always rushing through the morning. This Keurig has made my morning much less rushed, saving me a lot of time. It warms the water up and brews the coffee from the K-cup pod quickly (probably around 3-5 minutes). It also seemed the most reasonably priced. I also chose it because it seems to take less space than other Keurigs, but it also brews only one serving per brew (so that's a trade-off). As I share a house with others and our kitchen isn't the biggest, having a Keurig that didn't take up too much space was something I needed.<br /><br />A plus that I didn't really think about when I bought it was that I can use it to make tea as well.

If we were regular coffee drinkers, perhaps we would feel differently about it, as the water would cycle through the machine on a nearly daily basis.

The new unit arrived within a couple of days.  After following the preparation steps again and trying a fresh cup, this time the coffee tasted exactly as I expected... NO PLASTIC taste.  It's great!  There must be some sort of quality control process they need to fix, but I'm now a happy customer and was very pleased with Keurig's customer service.  This review is going from a one star to 4 stars just because they did everything they could to remedy this and the coffee tastes great.<br /><br />Old review: We bought the Keurig K55 after trying and loving them when at a relative's home.  After following the instructions to the letter on how to prepare and brew a cup of coffee, the first cup tasted horrible.  There was not only a smell of plastic to the coffee, but it tasted nothing like coffee and only of repulsive plastic.  Thinking the water in the reservoir was tainted because I might not have cleaned it out thoroughly, I brewed the water through and then added more purified water to the reservoir.  Same problem.  Finally, after doing the same thing a third time, I brewed a third cup of coffee and was equally disgusted... it was like the new car smell on a hot day, only it's in your coffee and on your tongue.  And it left a lingering taste on my tongue and throat.  This apparently is a common occurrence and recommendations of running vinegar through it seem to have limited success.  I'm doing that this morning, but I'm already planning on returning this if the taste of plastic doesn't disappear completely.",4,2018-02-12,,True,,"Tastes like disgusting plastic, even after preparing the coffee maker for first use",Color: Rhubarb,

The Keurig K55 comes with a small charcoal water filter fitted directly over the intake valve in the water tank.  The coffee tastes better due to this simple little filter.

5064,1,We've had this machine for 2 years and have just decided to give it away. It makes ok coffee and works well but in hindsight I wish we hadn't bought it - it's expensive to purchase and the kcups are very expensive no matter where we buy them. I think this is a good choice if you have a busy life and don't have time to wait for a conventional coffee maker to brew a pot - or if you only drink one cup of coffee per day. We have a Kitchenaid coffee maker and have used it exclusively for the past year while the Keurig sits untouched. The kcups are just too expensive when you drink more than one cup per day; we were using 4 to 8 kcups per day and it just wasn't cost effective. The water reservoir is difficult to remove and replace; a better engineering on the design is needed.

So that is my warning to you, it truly is only 3 stars (just ok).<br /><br />Cons: *The plastic on it is cheap, cheap, cheap. I use my own coffee grounds and when you take out the pod insert and put it back in it feels like the plastic might break at any time. *When you open the cover (handle) to put coffee in it does stay up all the way. When I put my coffee ground insert in I have to hold it open. * The water has to be filled with 25% still left in the reservoir. * The coffee does not come out as hot as my old one.<br /><br />Pros: *It makes a cup of coffee.<br /><br />My tip: Always, Always, Always sort the reviews by most recent first especially with products that have been around a long time.

5068,1,"We were given a Keurig as a Christmas gift many years ago and we became immediately hooked. We used that thing 4-5 times every day for the next several years without a single problem. Then about 2 months ago the pump started making strange noises and the water delivery became unpredictable. No big deal. Everything wears out in time, and after all the faithful service we've gotten from it, we certainly couldn't complain. So I ordered this one from Amazon on December 14, 2016. We were thrilled to have Keurig back in our lives, and everything ran perfectly with this new unit until a few days ago. And boy, we were not expecting what happened next...<br /><br />I put one of my favorite coffee brand K-cups into the holder and started brewing just like always. When it was finished, I walked back over to grab the cup and was immediately smacked in the face with an absolutely horrid smell. I picked up my cup and took a whiff of the coffee, and it honestly smelled like burning tires! It was a pungent, putrid, toxic smell. I stood there staring at the coffee in disbelief for several seconds, not even sure what to think or what to do. So I rinsed the cup out, popped another K-cup in, and pushed the button. Maybe the previous K-cup was bad, I thought. But to my dismay, the next cup came out with the exact sickening smell.<br /><br />Now I was totally bewildered. I had just brewed a cup of that exact brand earlier that same day, and it was fine. So I grabbed a totally different brand K-cup and brewed that one up, only to be hit in the face with the same burning tire smell again. Next, I ran two cycles of just plain water through the Keurig, and the smell was in the plain water, too! What the heck?!<br /><br />I did a quick search online and discovered pages and pages of people voicing the exact same complaint -- their Keurig had suddenly started spewing out toxic smelling drinks!

It's almost a Vanilla Creme from Starbucks.)<br /><br />Only downside is that the pods you have to buy for coffee are EXPENSIVE. But there IS a workaround. You can buy a small pod you can fill with your own ground beans that actually cost less than what you'd buy a pod for, and it's the exact same thing.<br /><br />If you drink tea, just simply don't put a pod in, just put your teabag into the cup, and it pours hot water.<br /><br />In college and don't feel like microwaving water for Ramen? Use this. The largest cup setting is just about 10% more than what you'll need, but you can always pour the excess water out.

5121,1,"Do you want a stimulating fresh cup of coffee each morning to start your day?  The Keurig K55 is a great home coffee maker in which I firmly believe was worth the money and will provide a spark to your morning.  For those of you who drink a cup of coffee to start your day, I recommend this product. The Keurig offers a very convenient and quick way to make a quality cup of coffee.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Quickness<br />• In less than 5 minutes, you can prepare and completely make a fresh cup of coffee, with the Keurig K55.<br />• This product allows you to skip pass your local Starbucks or Caribou coffee shop on your way to work or school, saving you valuable time each morning.  Your inconvenience of traveling out of your way and waiting in lines for coffee is eliminated.<br />*Convenience<br />• Simply fill your Keurig with water, press start to heat the water, place your selected K-cup pod into the Keurig, choose your preferred settings, and your coffee will be finished in no time.<br />• Coffee grounds free.  This product uses K-cups, which are liquid containers that produce your desired flavor.  The mess of using and the process of disposing coffee grounds is over.<br />• Cleaning this product is hassle free and time efficient.  Each of the parts that will need to be cleaned are dishwasher safe.  Cleaning it once every 2-3 months is recommended. This alone has saved me 5 minutes each morning, because I previously used to clean my old coffee pot each time before I used it.<br />• This coffee maker is small in size and will fit on all countertops.  My roommate has room for it on his desk.<br />*Quality<br />• The coffee tastes great and astonishingly you can choose from over 500  k-cup pod flavor varieties.  There are also over 75 top coffee brands you that offer these k-cup pods.<br />• Beverage options range from coffee, tea, cocoa, and more.<br />Cons:<br />*Noise<br />• While the Keurig K55 is heating the water and pouring the coffee it is loud.  It makes a loud humming sound, which would wake someone up who is in the same room.<br /><br />The Keurig K55 is my morning catalyst.

This is not a high volume machine.  Similarly to what other individuals have posted about this coffee maker, it goes through phases of death: 1) It only makes 1/2 a cup of coffee (if programed for 10 oz, it makes 5), 2) It becomes slow, dripping out those 5 oz over a period of 120 seconds, 3) There is no pressure to push the remaining fluid from the K-cup and the cup itself remains heavy with water, 4) It reaches a point of resurgence when the reservoir is 1/3 full, it will make a single cup of coffee in a fair amount of time and at the specified volume. Herein lies the challenge, keep the reservoir at a 1/3 filled, enough for 1-2 cups of coffee and refill it constantly.  We have registered our coffee maker with Keurig multiple times. It's easier to take the machine back to the local retailer and negotiate an exchange, the K55 Single Serve was our latest conquest.

We had not done that with our other Keurig and wonder if that was the problem.

I know, I used to own an Allstate Agency in Arlington Virginia (927 s Walter Reed Drive, at the NE corner of Columbia Pike and S Walter Reed Drive).  So I'd advise that you let Asurion know about this, otherwise, you will have a ton of customers down your throat.  Keurig would not give me in writing that the models were actually the same, even though I was told they were by 2 CSR's, before I got beyond their ranks.  You have a big problem on your hands.  You had better pull the added warranty option off of this item, and write a letter to everyone who has purchased an extended warrantee on it to let them know that they are still covered.

I was really shocked at how cheap this Keurig was for the &#34;same size&#34; and it had a few less features but it seemed close enough.  Well, this is a much bigger downgrade than I realized and it isn't really that good of a deal in retrospect.  There is no blue light in the water reservoir which makes it hard to tell how full it is.  It powers down on us for no apparent reason although we turn the &#34;auto-off&#34; feature off (maybe we bump it or something and turn the auto-off back on).  It just looks cheap to be honest.  The plastic and the gray handle are all just matte colored and I didn't think I cared looking on the computer but in real life, it is a bit disappointing.

There are three drawbacks to the design and this may not bother, others but worth noting. 1) The brew sizes are limited to 6oz, 8oz, and 10oz. A 12oz brew would be preferable as I have to use the 6oz brewing cycle, twice with one KCup to achieve the 12oz cup I normally drink. 2) The 48oz water container may be fine for some, but I fill it much more often than I would like and the machine consistently indicates &#34;add more water&#34; and will not brew when there is approximately 8oz of water remaining in the reservoir. 3) Many travel mugs, do not fit under the brew head, even when the bottom tray is removed.

5283,1,"A reluctant Home/Office Barista - when it comes to Home/Office coffee making, I go with a single-serve machine that is fast, simple to operate and makes Excellent Java.<br />Today, I’m reviewing the Keurig K55 Coffee maker, while comparing it to my most recently deceased K145 OfficePRO commercial brewer, so hold on to your coffee jug.<br />Also, at the end, I will share with you on 'How To Bling Your K55'! See Photo's.<br /><br />For anyone that brews 1 or x-number of cups a day, be coffee or tea, the Keurig Brewing system is both excellent in function and economical. It uses the Regular K-cups, which are available via different brands/flavors, including StarBucks, Costco/Kirkland, GreenMountain, Peets and many others:<br />1. Fast Brew & Simple to use - no measuring, no clean up.<br />2. No Waste - no burned coffee or going stale.<br />3. Selector Mode in precise 6, 8 & 10 ounce cup sizes. Travel cups included.<br />4. Option to use a Reusable/Refillable Filter Cup, for using your own brew.<br />5. Offers a variety of Branded roasts and flavors.<br />6. Can use a 4-cup carafe also.<br /><br />Con’s - Compared with my previous ‘K145 OfficePRO’ model, this K55 model is not to be expected with service for longer than 2 to 3 years, depending on Daily use patterns. My previous K145 OfficePRO model lasted a good 5+ years, of daily, heavy use.<br /><br />* The K55 is completely Plastic, except for the internal steel water tank & pump.<br />* Button Controls are arranged the same as the K145, but does NOT have a Selector, which I liked better, because I could just leave it “set” on a Brew Size permanently. On this one, it’s the last step, after loading the K-cup.<br /><br />How to BLING your K55 Coffee maker - See Photos - Since the K145 and the K55 are almost the same model (except for some upgrades for the K145), I Re-Cycled some Parts, and you can do this too:<br />1. I re-used the Chrome steel Cover from the K145, on the new Drip Tray.<br />2. I re-used the Silver-colored Water Reservoir Cover, from the K145.<br />3.

5321,1,"I should start by saying that I am NOT a coffee drinker.  Never have been, never will be.  But I work for a small office (4 of us total) and only one drinks coffee. Occasionally, we have potential customers come in and it's nice to be able to offer them coffee.  We started with a standard Mr. Coffee type coffee maker.  But the one individual who does drink coffee kept breaking the glass carafe.  So we moved on to a small, metal machine.  That only made about 1.5 cups at a time which wasn't efficient if we had more than one visitor.  The powers that be finally decided to splurge on a Keurig.  The coffee drinker was tagged to make the decision on which of the multitude of functions we needed.  We decided on this particular machine based on capacity, price and ease of use.<br /><br />When first ordered, I was given a delivery date weeks in the future.  Within 24 hours, that was changed to about 5 days.  It arrived on this second specified date.  It was well packaged to protect all the plastic and metal parts.  Came with detailed instructions that even a non-coffee drinker like myself could understand.  The filter was packaged separately and the directions did not specify when this should be inserted so I did this when someone else noticed it was missing.<br /><br />So it was easy to set up and even easier to use.  It arrived with a 4 pack of sample pods.  Since this is for the business use, I registered my Keurig on their website.  When I did this, I received a code to get 50% off my first order of pods (with a few exclusions).  So I ordered a box of coffee and a box of tea.  These both arrived within the next week.<br /><br />The water reservoir holds a lot of water and the auto shut off feature is a plus!<br /><br />I would recommend this as it's easy to set up, easy to use and easy to clean.  It's lightweight so you don't have to lug heavy pieces around.",4,2016-08-16,2.0,True,,Great for our small office,Color: Black,

5477,1,"After years of seemingly satisfactory performance (and great coffee), I noticed a serious problem with my previous K55--that no matter how much I cleaned and scaled all parts of the system, the underside of the water carafe (the water outlet hole) and surrounding environment smelled of stale water--what I would liken to the smell of &#34;old used sponges.&#34; Theorizing that it was a case of the machine just being too old or that the smell of vinegar, which I had been using in the cleaning process, was the source of the foul smell and could not be eliminated no matter what cleaning method I used. So I purchased this brand new Keurig K55, and within a few weeks of use, the carafe bottom developed the same foul odor as the previous machine. This time, I used Keurig's official cleaning solution (no vinegar) in the hope of eliminating the odor, but it had no effect. My water supply comes from the tap in a major urban area where the water quality is touted as pristine. I can't justify continuing to use this product because I don't know whether the seemingly unsanitary conditions under the carafe--apparently a design flaw--are effecting the safety of the coffee that the machine makes. Other than color differences, it appears that carafes of newer versions of Keurig machines are built the same way. Guess I'll need to stop using K-cups because I can't trust how sanitary such coffee makers are. Sad.",1,2017-05-27,,True,,Unsanitary Conditions Under the Water Carafe.,Color: Black,

5545,1,"When I first received this Keurig K55 Coffee Maker, I absolutely LOVED this machine! The K55 takes ALL K Cups, so my family & I had been enjoying different ones.<br /><br />It initially was not loud and took a very short time to get a fresh brewed..FULL..cup of coffee, hot chocolate or tea.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that did not last long before we started having our first problems with this unit. I'd say about a month into owning it.  This Keurig would sometimes give a full cup of coffee, but not always. I initially thought we just needed to clean it out more, etc. We always ran a full, clear {no K Cup inserted} cycle through the maker to make sure there were no 'gunk&#34; building up after using hot chocolate, flavored coffees, etc. We did that without fail every single time we used the Keurig K55 Maker with flavored coffees, hot chocolate or tea.<br /><br />The machine started making a lot of noise like it was about to start brewing though nothing happened except loud noises. The noises continued to get louder as it was just the machine running. There was no water leaving the reservoir to even go into the machine to mix with the coffee. At first, we got almost half a cup of coffee {from the largest setting}. Then no coffee or water at all. . Just loud 'brewing&#34; machine noises that did nothing.<br /><br />I also kept finding water around the machine, but thought maybe someone spilt some while filling the reservoir. It was not that, but instead leaking. It got worse as time went on and just one more frustration of trying to use this machine.<br /><br />We're not heavy coffee, tea, or hot chocolate drinkers...so this machine was maybe used once a day on average for a month and a half. {It was used about 3 or 4 times a day the first week when everyone wanted to try it out}. For a $100 coffee machine this should have lasted a lot longer AND been able to easily make multiple cups of coffee/tea/hot chocolate a day for a lot longer than two months.<br /><br />This was our first and LAST Keurig Coffee Maker.

5659,1,"Is this a good coffee maker: no.  It's k cups so you have to take that for what it is.  It's supposed to be Convenient.  Coffee has come down so much but K cups, per cup, remain VERY high.  The Green Mtn (Keurig's K Cup Brand) Coffee Fair Trade Organic Sumatran Reserve, K-Cup is the only one out of dozens I tried that tastes like something you'd get at a good upscale coffee house (thus the 2 stars).  Now it loses one star because this is not how you brew coffee.  The coffee never blooms, the water just passes though the grounds and into your cup.  Also, the average temperature temperature out of the needle (that flows into your K cup) is about 175F.  That's horrible!  Coffee should be brewed between 195F and 205F, nothing less, nothing more.  When you go higher you get burnt coffee (think of starbucks all the time).  When you go lower like the Keurig here you get sour coffee.  The Sumatran Reserve is the only exception which seems to tolerate both the terrible brew cycle and the under temperature water.  So lose another star for water temperature.<br /><br />So I said before, your giving up great coffee at a higher price per cup and convenience of a single cup when you want it. But my Keurig (your mileage will vary) had the top needle clogged within a week.  Really?  So I wasted two K cups trying to figure out what was wrong.  A paper clip and a flashlight and I had it cleaned again.  Convenience, no, no, I think not?  - 1 star.<br /><br />Bottom line (TL;DR).  Get a real coffee maker, one that guarantees brewing temps between 195F and 205F.  Don't fall for for the easy trap.  These people don't care about good coffee, and if you do, you won't buy a K Kup machine.",2,2017-05-28,2.0,True,,It's All About Temperature and Ground Saturation time - this is not coffee!,Color: Black,

We had it over 3 years after that before it had serious issues. It worked great up till then. We decided that since that one worked so well and was built to last, we would get this 'upgraded' version. Not so much of an upgrade. If they still made the older ones, I'd pay more for that than we paid for this. This one has such lightweight, cheap plastic. Even the catch plate that holds the liquid is plastic, whereas the original was made of metal. The pot is significantly louder when it's brewing and warming up. The top feels fragile (in comparison to the original) when you lift it up and put it back down, and clicks weird when putting it back down with a k-cup in place. I almost sent it back but my husband said we should keep it and use the warranty if something goes wrong. I got used to it, but it took time.

This is much better designed than the Mr. Coffee one.  It produces a stronger coffee that is hot and does not have to further heated in a microwave.  It heats up fairly quickly when turned on.  The water reservoir is large, and is easy to remove and refill.  The on/off button does not have to be held down for a few seconds to turn it off - it turns on/off immediately.  And, the interface is simple and easy to understand which is an absolute must for the elderly visitors that come to our home who are mystified when presented with too many buttons/options on technology.

Best part is that it automatically dispenses the right amout of water based on the size you select,  which I find results in a more consistent tasting cup of coffee.

If you keep it on at all times it is fine, but I only make one cup in the mornings. When you turn it on it automatically starts heating the water in an internal tank, which takes about a minute. Once that's done you can brew a cup, which also takes about a minute. Total brew time for the first cup of the day is about 2 minutes, which is longer than it took my mini keurig. Not a huge deal, but I was looking forward to it being quicker, and it's not.

6163,1,"I purchased a Keurig 475 for the house and, at Amazon, this Keurig 55 for the office. Both of these are part of the brand new 2.0 generation. When I used them, I was surprised at how bad the coffee tasted no matter what brand I used. It was flat and tasteless. I had Keurig-brewed coffee before and it had been better, although certainly not as good as coffee made with a press or filter drip system. Also, the coffee was lukewarm a minute after brewing. I thought this was odd. Then last week I was visiting a building that had an old Keurig coffee brewer and I had brought my own K-cups knowing that the ones provided were not very good. The coffee brewed by that machine was both hotter and tasted better and I realized what the problem was: the new Keurigs don’t heat the water at a high enough temperature to correctly brew coffee so its aromatic components are fully expressed. I searched the net using google about new Keurigs and brew temperature and got dozens of results that confirmed my conclusion.<br /><br />The proper temperature to brew coffee is 195-205 deg F. I know this since brew temperature is an important consideration to make good espresso which I have done for many years. Since I am a scientist, I conducted a simple experiment. I had three different thermometers on hand (a digital one, a laboratory-grade mercury one, and one designed to measure coffee and espresso brew temperature that uses a temperature-sensitive spring), and used them to measure (1) the temperature of water coming out of the brew head, (2) the temperature of the water collecting immediately in the cup, and (3) the temperature of the water after one minute. I then repeated these measurements with brewed coffee rather then freshly-heated water.<br /><br />Water and coffee will cool in the cup immediately and also after one minute. Coffee will be cooler than water because the coffee grounds that filter the water will also cool it. The temperatures were consistent with these facts. For both Keurigs, freshly-heated water out was 175 deg F, water in the cup immediately was 165 deg F, and water after one minute was 155 deg F. All three thermometers had these results within 2 degrees. Coffee out was 170 deg F, coffee immediately in the cup was 160 deg F, and coffee in the cup after one minute was 150 deg F, all 5 deg F cooler than water. The primary thing to notice here is that 175 deg F brew temperature is 20 deg LOWER than the lowest recommended brew temperature for coffee, 195 deg. After one minute, coffee in the cup is 150 deg which is not hot. This coffee will be lukewarm in another minute or two. Of course, if you add cold milk or half & half to your coffee, as I do, the coffee will be even cooler. My Keurig coffee with a very small amount of half & half in the cup after one minute was 140 deg F. (Note: the Keurig K475’s brew temperature can be adjusted; I adjusted mine to the highest possible temperature when I started it the first time. The K55’s temperature cannot be adjusted but it is permanently set to the highest brew temperature, 175 deg F. Why Keurig would want to provide an option in the K475 for any brew temperature cooler than 175 deg is a mystery to me. 175 deg should be the LOWEST adjustable brew temperature.)<br /><br />I read in the reviews that many Keurig purchasers returned their machines and bought something else. The selection of machines capable of brewing using K-cups is meager. One popular model is the Bunn My Cafe brewer which several reviewers and commenters claimed brewed coffee at 200 deg F. So I returned the K475 to the store I purchased it from, got a full refund, and gave the K55 to my wife—who prefers lukewarm coffee—for her office, and bought a Bunn My Cafe from Amazon. I tested it just as I did with the Keurig. Its water out/brew temperature was 195 deg F, not 200 deg as some claimed but still 20 deg hotter than the Keurigs and certainly in the range of proper coffee brewing temperature (although at the very bottom of the range). Every other temperature I tested with the three thermometers was 20 deg higher than the corresponding Keurig temperature. For example, freshly heated water in the cup was 185 deg, and brewed coffee in the cup was 170 deg after one minute, 160 deg if I added a very small amount of half & half. The brewed coffee was much better, with better flavor and more character, just like the coffee I was had obtained from old-model Keurigs that brewed at higher temperatures (these are not available anymore except in used condition and I wouldn’t recommend buying one because Keurigs wear out after a few years). The Bunn coffee was also hotter, of course, and didn’t become lukewarm for several extra minutes, usually long enough to finish an 8-ounce cup without it becoming too cool. It was clear to me that Keurig lowered the brewing temperature in their new line of machines by an outrageous 20 deg F to protect themselves from human scalding liability litigation without any consideration or mention of how well their machines brewed coffee at the proper temperature for the enjoyment of their customers.<br /><br />I read one comment chain in which several Keurig purchasers complained about the too-low brewing temperature and some very polite but stupid Keurig advocate kept recommending work-arounds. First he claimed that Keurigs heat the water to 192 deg for brewing, but that is untrue and nobody believed him anyway. Then he said: Heat your cup with hot water before using it for brewing. Buy an expensive stainless steel cup with double wall construction that provides superior insulation. Use a cup with a narrow rim that reduces cooling by having a smaller area for heat to escape. Put the coffee in a pre-heated travel mug that has a lid to keep the coffee hot. Heat the coffee in the microwave after you brew it. And so on. One very perceptive and angry responder pointed out that people buy Keurigs for convenience and don’t wish to indulge in time-consuming or expensive work-arounds. If they wanted good coffee with all the extra trouble, they would just brew it like they had before (filter drip, French press, espresso, etc.). Keurigs provide fast coffee for people in a rush with little extra time in the morning or during the day. Also, heating coffee in the microwave denatures the coffee by destroying the hundreds of aromatic organic compounds in the coffee with electromagnetic radiation. Microwave related coffee just tastes bad—I’m sure you’ve noticed. Why damage your coffee every time you brew it with a Keurig by heating it in the microwave? Keurig should just brew it right the first time.<br /><br />So I can’t recommend ANY Keurig 2.0 model. But I do recommend the Bunn My Cafe even though it is not quite as convenient as a Keurig. Also, there are other K-cup compatible coffee brewers such as Cuisinart. I haven’t tried one of those but you can and tell us the results.",1,2017-11-17,2.0,True,,I was surprised at how bad the coffee tasted no matter what brand I used,Color: Black,

6312,1,I had a keurig for 10 years and threw it away after the heating element failed. It was a wonderful product then. Got this one just 5 days ago and its one of the worst. The machine just makes noise and rarely makes a cup of coffee. Most of the time you are standing there for 10 -15 mins wondering what is going on... the lights rarely blink if you are lucky and you have to wait for such rare moments. And most of the time it does nothing and you just go out in disappointment. what a waste of my money and all my time staring at the machine every morning hoping it will make coffee,1,2018-12-10,,True,,one of the worst ever,Color: Rhubarb,

It powers on, heats the water, accepts the POD, the lights blink on the different cup sizes, and then after you select the cup size it clicks approx. 3 times and quits.

6400,1,"***Updates are located at the bottom of this review.***<br /><br />***Original Review***<br />Up until recently, I had never been much of a coffee drinker except for the occasional seasonal flavored latte drinks but I was having trouble keeping up with my very active twin toddlers. We already had a standard coffee maker but I didn't want to brew a whole pot of coffee at once and single-serve coffee makers seem to be very popular so I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. I had seen several different Keurigs from the basic ones to very fancy ones but wanted to purchase one that both fulfilled my needs to brew a single cup of coffee and wasn't too expensive so I opted to buy the Keurig K55 Coffee Maker in black.<br /><br />When the Keurig arrived, I eagerly opened up the box to get it set up and start using it! I found it fairly simple to set up since there is a Use and Care Guide included and it's easy to follow the step-by-step instructions. I'd say the setup only takes a few minutes and then you are ready to brew your first cup of coffee. There are lights on the brewer that illuminate and walk you through the brewing process but once you are used to it, it becomes second nature and now, I don't even have to think about it, which is good in the early morning when I'm not thinking straight and need my coffee!<br /><br />Brewing: To brew a cup of coffee is very simple. You'll need to turn on the brewer by pushing the power button. The power button and heating lights will illuminate and the Keurig will make some noises while it heats up. When the three cup sizes illuminate in blue, you know it's time to brew your coffee. Set your coffee mug on top of the drip tray and lift the handle for the K-cup pod holder. Place a K-cup pod in the holder and lower the handle completely until the three cup sizes are blinking. The three sizes are: small cup (5.25 ounces), small mug (7.25 ounces) and large mug (9.25 ounces). Select your size and the coffee will be ready in about a minute. If the water reservoir is low on water, the &#34;add water&#34; light will illuminate and the process won't continue until you've filled the reservoir. Once it's stopped dripping, you may remove your mug and enjoy your coffee! If someone else wants to brew a cup of coffee right after yours is done, all they have to do is remove your K-cup pod since they are single-use pods, add theirs and repeat the process.<br /><br />Water Reservoir: The reservoir holds 48 ounces of water so you don't have to fill it up every time you want to brew a new cup of coffee, which is one of the reasons I selected this model. I make about two cups of coffee every day so I end up refilling the reservoir every few days. There are filters to use with the water but I purchase bottled water so I haven't used the filters at this point. When the reservoir needs to be filled, I remove the reservoir, take off the lid, fill it up with water, place the reservoir back in the Keurig and replace the top.<br /><br />Cleaning: I feel this Keurig is fairly simple to clean. The drip tray is removable and I usually wipe it down with a damp paper towel a couple times a week and wash it in water, soapy water occasionally. I also like to wipe down the exterior since the front part of the Keurig gets splatters of coffee on it. You can also clean the pod holder, funnel, needles and water reservoir and lid. Be careful as the two needles used to puncture holes in the K-cup pods are very sharp.<br /><br />Coffee Pods (the best part!): The Keurig K55 Coffee Maker uses the K-cup pods, which you can purchase nearly everywhere and there are many brands and flavors to choose from. You don't need to buy any specific brand with this coffee maker. As long as they are K-cups, they should work and I haven't come across any pods that don't work. I've been having a lot of fun purchasing different flavors and brands since I have several friends and family members who also have Keurigs so it's a lot of fun to swap coffees! I prefer flavored coffees and there are so many out there to try but my favorites are the Green Mountain flavors in Caramel Vanilla Creme and Wild Mountain Blueberry. There are K-cup pods in different price ranges and it's nice to have that option since everyone has a different budget. The nice thing with this brewer is that the flavors don't tend to blend from one cup to the next. For instance, my mom and I have brewed cups of coffee one right after the other (different flavors) and neither of us have noticed the other flavor in our respective cups. I've only brewed one cup of apple cider with this and haven't noticed the previous coffee flavor in the apple cider or the apple cider in my next cup of coffee. In this brewer, you can use all kinds of coffee flavors from flavored to medium and dark roasts to hot chocolate to apple cider. I typically choose the small mug (7.25 ounces) setting since I like the flavor. It isn't too strong or too watered-down for me but others may prefer other settings.<br /><br />Programmable Auto Off Timer: You can set the brewer to turn off two hours after the last cup of coffee has brewed (included in the instructions). I just turn the Keurig on and off as I need it but it's nice to have that option.<br /><br />Noise: Some people have stated that this brewer is noisy. I've found it's the noisiest when it's taking water from the reservoir and it sounds like a loud hum. It's not too loud when it's brewing the cup of coffee. I occasionally get up earlier than my husband and kids and brew a cup of coffee and no one has woken up (I'd say there is about 30 feet between the kitchen and bedrooms with the doors closed). When we have guests and they brew coffee before I wake up, I can't hear it at all.<br /><br />This Keurig is made in China and mine had a packaging date of August 2016, a month before I purchased it. I've been using it for two months and haven't had any problems with it at all. It measures about 12 inches deep (from front to back), nine inches wide (side to side) and 13 1/2 inches tall. I've had several family members use it and my parents and in-laws have found it fairly simple to use after I show them how to brew the coffee since we all have different models. Ever since I started drinking coffee, I've had better success with staying more alert and awake to take care of my twins and buying this Keurig has been well-worth every penny we spent on it! I have no regrets buying it and have been having a lot of fun finding different flavors to try. As with all of my reviews and especially any appliances and electronics reviews, I will periodically update this review, add in any new information I discover and adjust my thoughts and star rating, if needed. If you, or someone you know, is interested in a Keurig, I highly recommend this one. It's a great model that is nice on your wallet and will brew a great cup of coffee as often as you'd like!<br /><br />***Update 04/25/2017 - I've had this Keurig now for almost eight months and it's still working great for us! I typically brew four cups of coffee a day now to keep up with my kids and I've had no trouble with using this Keurig. When we have guests and are switching pods a lot, I never notice a strange taste at all (since we all like different flavors). I clean out the drip tray and wipe the whole machine down at least once a week to keep it looking nice. We only use bottled water in it so I've never had to use the filter. When we go away for a few days, I always wipe everything down and empty the water reservoir so it can air out and dry. I still highly recommend this Keurig if you want a good single-cup brewer that isn't incredibly expensive!",5,2016-11-02,1649.0,True,,This Keurig is My Favorite Kitchen Appliance and It's Well-Worth the Money We Spent!,Color: Black,

BUT a basic model such as this K55 is the ideal model that you'd want because it meets all of your requirements. Be it your home or workplace, this basic version serves a piping hot cup of coffee without all of the frills. While the K575 is aesthetically pleasing with its monitor, it does the EXACT same thing as this one but at the fraction of the price. No matter what model you choose, you will always have to wait for it to heat up and dispense. It's inevitable and no way around that regardless of machine. With my other Keurigs, I've noticed that lagging is common, especially when handling the screens. Considering that you have to touch and maneuver your selections instead of manually pressing buttons, you waste time waiting for it as it stalls. Be it to a few seconds to a several minutes, it's frustrating to deal with something that's SUPPOSED to be more efficient and time-saving when in actuality it isn't. With my K55, I don't have to worry about that. A simple press of a button and it's ready to go! A huge plus is the rhubarb color it comes in----absolutely beautiful!<br /><br />So far it has been working well without any hiccups. If there's any issue, I will update my review.",4,2017-02-13,392.0,True,,So Far So Good,Color: Rhubarb,

However, we feel that the Keurig K55 coffee maker has proved superior to any of our previous coffee brewers.<br /><br />Last year I invested in our first Keurig coffee maker, and I chose the K15 for individual servings. This worked out so well that a few months later, I bought another for my office and I loved my second Keurig as much as I loved the first one. Then last winter I decided to purchase another Keurig, only a different model that would accommodate several servings.<br /><br />I bought the K55 model because it has various featured options. This includes offering the choice for different hot beverages without the extra step to refill the tank each time with water, and this is due to the larger 48 oz. water reservoir. In addition, this enables us to make a variety of hot beverages in rapid succession, within a few seconds instead of waiting for all the water to reheat.  Furthermore, the Keurig K55 offers a personal ‘custom tailored’ brew by letting us determine the strength of our coffee, and we have a choice of three. The smallest amount for a 6 oz. provides the strongest brew and the other two servings are an 8 and 10 oz.<br /><br />I like strong coffee, or sometimes I like to have flavored coffee, and my sister-in-law likes the same coffee that I do. My husband prefers a milder brew, and he never drinks flavored coffee. My son drinks tea, and likes to try different varieties and my grandson loves sampling different selections of hot chocolate.<br /><br />The Keurig K55 has a fast set-up, with easy to follow and systematic directions from the manual. It offers us a variety ways to make coffee, tea or just to heat water and all without any major modifications, because it just goes from one task to another.<br /><br />Below are some of the general features, and all are well designed and ‘user friendly’.<br /><br />CONTROL PANEL:<br /><br />All the controls are on the top right of the coffee maker and I like the flat slope surface that slightly slants down toward my eye level, and therefore, I don’t need to step on my tiptoes to read the buttons.<br /><br />On the panel, there are 5 press buttons and each one has an LED light to reduce ‘user error’.<br /><br />Power: Green LED<br />Auto Off: Green LED - (this is the automatic timer and when activated will automatically power off after 2 hours).<br />3 Brew Size Servings – corresponding size to the serving size and each with a Blue LED<br />a.  Cup Size - yields 6 oz. – which will provide the strongest brew<br />b.  Small Mug - produces 8 oz.<br />c.  Large Mug – dispenses 10 oz.<br /><br />Aside from the 5 press buttons to regulate the Keurig coffee maker, there are 3 other LED light indicators.<br /><br />1.  Add Water – a Blue LED will light up<br />If there is not enough water, the coffee maker will not work, therefore I consider this indicator as a safety feature, as well as a resolution to a possible ‘user error’.<br /><br />2.  Descale – will light up with a Red LED light<br />This is another handy feature, to indicate necessary cleaning maintenance.<br /><br />3. Heating – while the water is heating, a red LED powers on, and then powers off when the water is hot and ready for a brew.<br /><br />WATER RESERVOIR:<br /><br />Included with the Keurig K55 is a Charcoal Water filter Cartridge Kit with 2 charcoal filters. This will eliminate the unwanted chemical taste that is in some water systems, and good tasting water is essential for a delicious cup of coffee. The recommended life span for each charcoal filter is approximately 2 months or 60 ‘full-tank’ refills. There are several selections for Replacement Charcoal Filter-Pods available on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The water reservoir attached to the left side is easy to remove with a slight lift up and outward motion. It fits inside a base and the tank is easy to remove and replace without any struggle. Alternatively, remove the reservoir tank cover, and pour water in from a bottle or a container.<br /><br />DRIP TRAY:<br />This is much more than ‘just a drip tray’, under the cover is a 1” deep receptacle that will accommodate 8 oz. of a liquid spillover. Therefore, if the user makes an error and pushes the wrong brew amount for a smaller cup, this will save the kitchen counters and the floor from a major flood.<br />In addition, this coffee maker will accommodate my 7 ¼” coffee thermos by sliding the drip tray out from bottom base, and I can have my thermos filled when placed on the bottom flat tray base.<br /><br />THE KEURIG K55 ACCOMMODATES REUSABLE COFFEE FILTERS:<br /><br />My favorite coffee is from fresh beans that I grind myself, and therefore it’s important to me that a coffee maker will accommodate a reusable filter. The K-Cup pod holder on the K55 is very easy to remove and it literally takes less than 10 seconds. Just tap the bottom of the pod holder with a finger and the K-Cup holder slides out with ease. The reusable K-cup filter then slides in place within the groove, and works with perfection for a delicious cup of fresh ground beans, or any ground coffee.<br /><br />The reusable coffer pod filter that I use is the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (Single) – and this is compatible with the Keurig K55 model.<br /><br />I purchased this from Amazon last spring, and in addition, I use this same filter with my Keurig K15.<br /> https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-5048-Reusable-Coffee-Filter/dp/B000DLB2FI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486296530&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Keurig+My+K-Cup+Reusable+Coffee+Filter+%28Single%29<br /><br />In conclusion, the Keurig K55 is a well thought-out designed coffee maker, with user-friendly features. This machine comes with a ‘Charcoal Water Filter Cartridge Kit and 2 charcoal pod filters, which guarantees excellent coffee, even though we have ‘hard water’ (which tastes awful) in our water system. In addition, I love that Keurig does NOT use a breakable glass carafe, which was the thing that broke most often with our previous coffee makers.",5,2017-02-08,833.0,True,,Well-Designed with Superior Performance -The Very Best Coffee Maker That We Have Owned In 40 Years,Color: Black,

6404,1,"This was our second Keurig. We first experienced it at my cousin's house. We were staying there when our new house was being remodeled. We absolutely loved the Keurig. Bought one immediately when we moved into our new home. That one lasted about a year and a half and then just quit working. Replaced it with this one, the Keurig K55. That one lasted about a week and quit working. We then purchased another at Walmart as the return period is longer and it was one sale. The new one just failed after about 6 months. It works now and then but once we use up the rest of our cups we are back to our old coffee maker. We really like Keurigs when they work, however 3 units failed in 2 and a half years is too much. We haven't tried to return or contact Keurig on warranty and probably won't.

6406,1,"There are quality control issues with this unit.  I also believe there are design flaws.  I am very familiar with this unit as many friends have it, and I have used it without incident.  However, from the very start, my unit was hit or miss: sometimes it would brew and sometimes it would just shut off with no output.  When it did brew, the output was very low: 10%-25% of what the output should be.<br /><br />I carefully cleaned all of the nozzles with a paperclip to make sure there no blockage on both the three nozzles above the coffee pod and the one nozzle/pin below it.  (If there is anything impeding flow from any of these tiny points of failure the machine stops.)  I made sure I was using official Keurig pods.  Never worked right.<br /><br />When I could think of no other options I contacted the Keurig. To their credit, I got a live knowledgeable person with almost no wait.  They walked me through some diagnostics.The output was fine if there was no pod.  If there WAS a pod, output was low.  Support person said I have a fault pod basket, that had a malformed output needle that impeded flow.  She is sending me a new one, hopefully one that works.<br /><br />The Keurig design has very sensitive points of failure.  If there is any abnormality of flow among these four very tiny channels, the machine will malfunction.  To keep it operating, you need to constantly be checking the nozzles, descaling periodically, using filtered or bottled water. etc.  That was manageable however.<br /><br />The problem is that their manufacturing quality is insufficient for the design of the machine. Now made in China, the manufacturing quality control does not meet the tolerances required by the design.  Once revered machines the Keurig brewer is now cheap junk.<br /><br />Sadly, Keurig is not what it once was.  Founded in 1992, Keurig was known for quality machines.  However, they were purchases by Green Mountain Coffee in 2006, and then in 2016, Keurig Green Mountain was acquired by a private equity firm.  These changes may have had an effect on the quality of the hardware.<br /><br />I would not recommend this machine, and will probably throw mine out.

Perhaps this is a defective batch of machines? I have owned several Keurigs over the years and they have never given me trouble. The one that I replaced with these two had lasted about 6 years before it started leaking water from some internal secret space. I'm going to try a different brand now.

It is very annoying and I have tried all the internet and customer service fixes and it still happens. They replaced the first one that was still under warranty and then the one they replaced it with started doing the same thing. I use the filter that you put your own coffee in and you end up with a half cup of coffee and the filter apparatus full of water then the next time you make a cup it may not do it. Also you descale it which is a big pain to get the vinegar totally out of it and then maybe a week or two later it will say to descale it again.

6661,1,"I bought this as a birthday present for my husband (not from Amazon) because he was always asking about one. I drink about 5 cups (really 2.5 mugs) of drip coffee in the morning and felt that the Keurig would be a very expensive way to get coffee and those little plastic throwaway cups aren't recyclable. But it was on sale and he had a birthday coming up. He uses it everyday for his one cup and thinks the taste is &#34;meh&#34; compared to what I make in my drip pot. But it's convenient - IF YOU ONLY DRINK ONE CUP OF COFFEE.  I bought the Melita JavaJig to use our regular beans and the coffee was way too weak. I've just purchased a burr coffee grinder to use with whole beans. The beans will have to be ground to near powder to brew satisfactorily. This extra grinding process negates the conveniece factor. If you enjoy tasty coffee, this is not a good product. If you want the coffee to have any flavor at all you have to use the medium or expresso setting. If you need quick tasty coffee, a Starbucks Via would be a better choice.",1,2016-09-06,,,,Meh. Don't bother.,Color: Black,

We use reverse osmosis water and we happily made two cups each per day for three years before water came out the bottom during operation. So, buy it and know that it has a limited life, the cost of the machine is perhaps three cents per cup produced. I unpackaged our fourth one today and likely will be required to replace it in 2019.",4,2016-07-11,2.0,,,Excellent machine for a residence but in some cases won't last for more than 4000 cups before leaking,Color: Black,

And I say this knowing that these are my neighbors (I live in the Vermont town that is home to their major operations center).  I'm sorry Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is now a Keurig company.

But then I realized even though they don't offer a 12oz cup, I could still get one by running the 6oz cup twice.  One problem solved.  The only other issue is the water reservoir.  It doesn't have a convenient flap like the k75 so I could just lift the hinged flap and pour in my water.  It is also smaller in size as the old pot.

Then it did start working OK for several weeks after which it began acting up again. Called Keurig and they had me clean the needles to no avail. Called them again and they tried to blame the problem on my water. They said I needed filtered water or bottled water for the machine to work properly. Well I am not going to the expense or trouble of installing an expensive filter system or hauling bottles water around in order to make coffee. I never needed to do that with our old Mr Coffee! Besides, there is no warning on the box or sales info that you have to use filtered water. To tell you that after the purchase is a little self serving in my opinion. And obviously the filter you get with the machine in inadequate for proper filtering, so why are they selling it? However, after some prodding on my part they did agree to send me a new machine. It worked great, for two days! Then it began doing the same thing as the first one.

6668,1,"Keurig K55/ K-Classic Coffee Maker<br /><br />Ready for on the go!<br /><br />The Keurig K55/ K-Classic Coffee Maker has made my mornings a breeze while trying to get ready for classes. As college students we may not be the best morning people for those early morning classes, I sure was not. I received this as a gift a couple months ago and it has changed my morning routine for the better. The Keurig K55 is durable, reliable, quick, and easy to use each morning.<br /><br />Durability:<br />It’s compact enough to fit in an apartment or a dorm room without taking too much space. There are three different cup sizes available to choose from; the options are 6, 8, and 10 ounces of delicious coffee. The water reservoir holds up to 48 ounces of water, allowing brewing roughly 5 large cup sizes. When the water starts to get low the “add water” light will turn on. Additionally, the Keurig K55is a removable tray that accommodates travel mugs up to 7.1 inches to take your coffee on the go and is serves as a drip tray. This drip tray is easy to clean and is available to use on the top rack of dishwasher.<br /><br />Reliable:<br />Using this coffee maker in the morning makes me save easily over 5 minutes in the morning to make a coffee. It takes under 2 minutes for the Keurig to heat up and then brewing the coffee takes less a minute to do. The Keurig comes equipped with an energy saver button that is always activated when the coffee maker is turned on. This energy saver is programmable to turn off automatically.<br /><br />Variety:<br />The energy saver button is really helpful on a busy morning where you are just on the go. All that needs to be done is turn on the Keurig, pop in the K-cup pod drink mixer of your choice, have your coffee mug ready, and press the desired cup size and then done, simple as that. There is a vast selection to choose from when it comes to the K- cup pods, this selection of types and brands rang from different coffee flavors to hot tea to cappuccinos or even hot chocolate flavors. I personally am still in the process of trying different brands of coffee and different flavorings. But, if you are like myself that is obsessed with a coffee that does not come in a K-cup pod there is still a solution.

6701,1,"Bought directly thru Keurig, within 4 weeks got louder and louder when brewing.  Took longer and longer to brew the cup of coffee. Finally didn't brew correct amount and then stopped brewing all together. Keurig has excellent customer service so new one sent to replace. This new one within 3weeks is doing the exact same thing.  Keurig has compromised their quality over the years, these coffee makers used to last longer.  Now seem to be cheaply made.  I'm done with keurig.",1,2016-12-27,,,,Don't buy.

6702,1,"Every time I am in a situation where one of these is the only option I am reminded of just how terrible they are.

Just make a cup of tea.",1,2017-06-23,,,,Junk at a premium price,Color: Black,
6703,1,"This is an update to an earlier review.  I intended to return the unit because of the plastic taste in the brewed drinks.  I took a chance and kept the machine instead and used the descaling procedure as described on the company's website using the vinegar method.  This method allows straight vinegar to sit in the heating unit for at least four hours and that seemed to make the difference as opposed to just running diluted vinegar through it as others have suggested.  However after two months the brewer stopped working.  I am the only person who uses it for a maximum of two cups a day.  Keurig has sent me a replacement, however, they replaced it with a K40 instead of the K55.  I have not used the K40 yet but will put it through the vinegar descaling process first.  They reserve the right to replace with lesser models and refurbished models and it seems that these units often require warranty replacements.  I am the kind of person who only really enjoys a freshly brewed cup of coffee and this does make great coffee once the plastic taste was gone, but I doubt I would purchase one again given the short life span.",2,2016-05-10,,,,Got rid of the plastic taste but brewer only lasted two months....,Color: Black,

6751,1,"Pros: Makes good coffee very quickly and with little or no preparation or cleanup, so I give it 5 stars mainly for being so convenient. Cons: While the coffee is good, it is not quite as good as coffee made carefully using a French press or Aeropress or similar techniques, so if you are a &#34;coffee snob&#34; you may find the coffee made with the Keurig to be so-so. Also, the coffee it makes is not super-hot, so if you add milk or cream it may be a cooler cup of coffee than you are used to. Bottom line: Outstanding convenience and good coffee flavor make this great for day-to-day coffee making.

6901,1,"My husband and I are looking for one machine that will brew 1-2 cups of coffee for him and 1-2 cups of coffee for me each morning. We want to avoid having two machines taking up precious counter space.  We also wanted to use our own coffee grinds and tea bags since that is more friendly to both our pocketbook and the environment. We thought this Keurig K55 was the answer. It's not.<br /><br />Before using the Keurig for the first time, we washed the water reservoir and the Reusable K-Cups and ran a cleansing cycle. We read and followed the instructions for using the K-Cups and brewing worked like a charm.<br /><br />Hubby tried to brew a 10-oz cup of coffee with a grind similar to granulated sugar to get the most flavor and he immediately noticed that his coffee tasted weak plus there was a residue left in the bottom of his cup. Here's the problem. The general rule for coffee-making is 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for each six ounces of water. This means he would need to use 3.33 tablespoons for 10 ounces of water. But the Reusable K-Cups hold just over 2 tablespoons -- not nearly enough for a 10-oz  cup.  Also, to avoid the residue he would need to use a more course grind, which would only weaken the flavor further.<br /><br />Next I brewed a 10-oz cup of English Breakfast tea, with a second Reusable K-Cup. The cup emitted a strong chemical odor, but I tried drinking it anyway. The chemical (plastic?) taste was so strong that the cup was undrinkable (poured it into the kitchen sink). I tried a second cup with the same result.<br /><br />Admittedly, we didn't try the K-Cups that are made for use with this machine. But we went into it knowing that we didn't want to and seeing the Reusable K-Cups as a viable alternative. They are not.<br /><br />And so the search continues.

7296,1,"I am not a &#34;verified purchaser&#34; because I used a couple of Target gift cards to buy a replacement for a Keurig purchased several years ago and which worked like a dream for nearly five year before dying.  The same machine I see listed on Amazon for $450 -$500 now.  Instead, I bought this machine and it the worst POS I have ever seen.<br /><br />The only way to describe how bad it is to imagine the engineers at Keurig HATE you and me.  (Maybe because I use generic pods instead of their over-priced gourmet pods.) As best I can tell, every function of this model is designed as if the engineer was out to RUIN the Keurig experience and take you down with the company.<br /><br />Start with the water reservoir which is too small and hard to remove.  The lid fits snuggly inside the container and has no handle or ridge by which you can grab-it.  So you end up pushing  on one side of the container to lift it out.  Eventually the pressure forces the lid to pop off and go flying across the room.  This happens almost every time you try to fill it.<br /><br />There are only three buttons for selecting the cup size.  None actually produce the amount of coffee you want. You will have to decide which combinations of buttons to push to get want you want.  Of course, the Keurig has to cycle through the entire process so you will not be able to push a button and come back to a ready cup of coffee - no, you have to do it twice - each time for a cup larger than about 7 ounces.<br /><br />But wait, there's more.  When using generic pods the Keurig leaks around the top.  If you do not position the mug in the exact spot you will come back to a pool of coffee on your counter top.  And you will be back, because you are going to have to open it up to reset the buttons so you can do a second run....<br /><br />Did I mention to &#34;low water&#34; light is gone and replaced with a tiny little light on the top.  It very easy to notice when you come back to the Keurig and are standing in front of it wondering why there is no coffee in your cup.  The light is obvious then.  In the old model a light flashed in the water tank.  Annoying, but easy to see.  Now its a little special surprise to start your day off bad... Thanks designers...<br /><br />And lastly, after only about a year the Keurig stopped working.  Remember, my first Keurig lasted five years with two adults making coffee every single day of the week.  I never descaled the original or did anything to keep it working.  The replacement lasted less than a year...<br /><br />This machine is crap.  Buy it at your own risk.  My advice is run away and find another brand....  The design is INTENTIONALLY Bad - there is no other explanation...",1,2018-01-31,,,,Designed by a company that HATES you.,Color: Black,

7298,1,"I replaced my coffee maker with this one, it's the same brand. It doesn't have as big of a water reservoir. I honestly didn't think it mattered since I am the only one who drinks it. I only have 2 cups a day. Every other day I am out of water. And the irritating thing is there's nothing that tells you ahead of time that you're out of water. There's no light Illuminating the water so you can see it's level. The only way I know I'm out of water is once I put my coffee cup under it and push the buttons for coffee. It starts to make its noise like it's working. I walk away only to come back and there's no coffee. Then I see that the light saying it's out of water is illuminated.  It doesn't notify you ahead of time. It is so frustrating so now I'm waiting even longer for that first cup of coffee having to put the water in and wait till it gets ready enough to make my coffee. I would not buy this again. Even though it's just me and I only have two cups a day, I need a bigger water reservoir. I'm so tired of it always being out of water. It wouldn't be so bad if it alerted you ahead of time. The light does not come on to tell me I'm out of water until after I put my cup under it push the button and walk away. It should have been lit before I went to go make my coffee. Why does it have to wait until I push the button and it makes the normal noise like it's working only then to figure out there's not enough water to make my cup of coffee. I've had really good luck with my Keurig coffee maker before this.

7316,1,"Generally I like it and it works well.  Unfortunately it is not consistent.  I use a mug and so I always use the mug (largest quantity of the three settings).  Sometimes I get a mug full.  Sometimes I get only the amount that should go with the middle setting.  Finally I figured out what I think is the problem--if I have refilled the tank so that it is full or almost full, it will give the proper amount, but if I have only a half tank it delivers a smaller quantity of water.  So I knocked it to 4 stars because I should not have to fill it when it is still 2/3 full of water.<br /><br />UPDATE October 22, 2017:  Well, after 5 months of occasional  use (a few times a week), it failed today.

Set it up on the counter. Jumped on Amazon to order some k-cups and after being shocked at the prices promptly boxed it back up.  No way am I going to spend 60¢ or more per cup of coffee.

7403,1,"After reviewing various coffee makers I finally succumbed to purchasing a Keurig as it appears that everyone has one in their household.  Why am I giving this product a 2 star rating when I have not even yet unpacked item?  After my purchase I begun investigating how much of the water in the form of coffee you drink from the Keurig coffee maker makes contact with plastic.  Originally I figured I could purchase a stainless steel K-cup and refill them myself which I believe can still be done.  However, after my correspondence with Keurig I learned that although the water tank where the water is boiled is stainless steel, there is still piping that is plastic that leads the boiling hot water to your k-cup.  Per Keurig &quot; the water that passes from the internal water tank to the Portion Pack Holder does so by way of plastic tubing&quot;  Although this plastic is BPA free, that does not make me feel comfortable when you have boiling water passing through plastic every day to make a cup of coffee.  Given all the new studies revealing the health dangerous of hot water not to mention boiling water in contact with plastics, I decided it’s not work the risk of a simple cup of coffee. I am still searching for a coffee maker that uses all internal stainless steel parts including the tubing where hot or boiling water makes contact that can also easily make a single cup of coffee.",1,2018-01-15,,,,Is one cup of coffee worth the possible health risk?,Color: Black,
7404,1,"So far so good... I've been using this K55 brewer a couple weeks and really like it. I had previously tried the K250 and the Mixpresso brewers. Both of those were just not hot enough (160* F after multiple testings and use) and the flavor was not as good. Further, the K250 brews too fast (30 sec. for 8 oz.) so you have to use &#34;strong&#34; for everything (slows the brew time to 1:25 or so, in pulses).<br /><br />I hemmed and hawed about buying this K55, in light of my experiences of Keurigs brewing weak, not hot, poor tasting coffee. I saw one at work, so I brought in a thermometer to test the water temp - it brewed out at 180*F, HOT. Well, I bought a black one at a local store, and upon some testing, mine brews at 170*F, pretty good. I think it is the best if you let it heat up, then brew a water brew, so everything (and the cup) gets hot, then brew the coffee.<br /><br />Here are the brew times I've noticed with the K55:<br />6 oz: 30 sec.<br />8 oz: 35 sec.<br />10 oz: 45 sec.  (used to be 1:11, now it's faster, darn it)<br /><br />The (formerly) slower brew time for 10 oz. allows some more heating and extraction, but I still mostly prefer the 6 oz or 8 oz. setting. Of note, if anyone is interested, besides the &#34;roast level&#34; of a K-cup (mild, medium, dark, etc), what has really helped me is to look at the WEIGHT of the K-cups when you are buying boxes.<br /><br />For me, anything 11g or more can work on 8 oz. size; less weight tastes better on 6 oz. Starbucks, Newman's, Peets are 11-12.5g per cup, so they have a stronger, fuller taste than, say 8 o'clock Colombian or GM Nantucket blend.<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/2017:<br />Having used this brewer for several months, it still functions well, is easy to use with 3 main buttons, no LCD, easy to fill tank. However, I am just not happy with the taste of the coffee. It still tastes too weak for me, even the stronger cups. Sometimes they taste weak but burnt, just poorly extracted. If there was a way to, say, double the brew time to 1 minute, then the taste should markedly improve.<br /><br />I compared the taste to a small Mr. Coffee 4-cup maker and the Mr. C. hands down has far better extraction, fullness, flavor, taste, temperature, caffeine, etc. Quickness of brew is convenient, but not if the result is weak or poor coffee taste. I have even tried putting a mug with a Melitta pour-over cone with a filter and 2.5 TBSP coffee in it, brew hot water from the K55 on it, and that tastes better than a typical K-cup. So I don't know what to do now, ugh.",3,2017-05-26,,,,Coffee could be stronger; temp is 170*F,Color: Black,

Literally everywhere I touch results in scratches looking terrible. I honestly had no idea such a pathetic finish was even used in the production of things that are meant to be touched.

One other problem is that on occasions, it spits coffee out the top, where the poker is, making a mess, as coffee doesn't completely come out the bottom, as it should.

We'll now be embarking on the journey of exploration into the world of K-Cup's, seemingly ubiquitous and with every imaginable flavor and variation possible.<br /><br />My only reservation is the cost of each cup. For this convenience it is necessary to accept that you're paying something around 50 cents to a dollar per cup, depending on what you purchase and in what quantities (and where).

7500,1,"I've owned (or have used) three of these particular models now.  I've gone one at home and have used it for about nine months.  Maybe make 1-2 cups of coffee a day and its worked like a champ.  However...  we've had two of these at the office and its the opposite experience.  It might be that they're not intended to hold up to heavy duty use, but in our office we probably had 20-25 people a day making at least one cup if not more.  Neither machine lasted more than 2-3 months.  Both worked great out of the box, but the first one developed horrible bitter/burnt tasting coffee.  At first, we returned the coffee but found that if we used the coffee in a different Keurig machine it tasted great.  We chucked the first one and got a second one.  Like the first one, it worked great for a couple months but after a while it would only dispense maybe 2-3 ounces of coffee despite being set on 10 ounces.  A couple people did enjoy the super-strong coffee that resulted but most didn't.  We just ended up going back to our traditional brewed coffee system.<br /><br />So, my experience is that if you have infrequent use, it seems to be pretty reliable (based on one observation).  If you subject these machines to constant use, they won't be able to handle it and they break down.  Either try one of the heavy duty models available or stick with a traditional coffee maker.",3,2018-09-26,,True,,My experience is a mixed bag,Color: Black,

Lesson Learned.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I received an immediate and friendly message from Keurig asking that I call customer service to have my issue resolved.  I did so.  They wanted information I didn't have, and to walk me through the troubleshooting steps that I had already tried.

Is does take kcups of all varieties so that's a plus. And we got a Black Friday price of $59 which was exceptional. Is it worth $75 I don't think so I would add another $25 and get the better version that bruise a larger cup and has the flip lid and possibly an LED with Auto on auto off.

You can buy a reusable k cup and add nothing in it, this will make a great hot cup of water or you can add your own loose leaf tea to the cup and get tea however most tea can't be brewed this way without burning your tea but works great with nettle or rosehip and hibiscus flower, these aren't actual teas so I think that's why it works fine. There's tones of k cup flavors too 😍 I had to make a drinking station after I got mine because I find i can have so many choices with this wonderful machine I ended with way more than the average joy would want.

7699,1,"I have a few concerns, but overall I am happy with my purchase. This is my first Keurig so I am learning as I go. For new Keurig owners that like to drink tea, it may be difficult to find a variety of the delicious flavors that you are used to in your local stores. Look to Amazon, or I usually do a hot water cycle and leave a tea bag in my cup. If you like loose leaf tea, you need to purchase the filter because this model does not come with one.<br />You may also notice that the water may come out of the machine hot, but it does not stay hot. Plenty of users have complained about this issue, and of the reluctance of having to reheat their fresh cuppa after 5 minutes. I am sure the water is not boiling temperatures. Use your microwave, or do a few hot water cycles after inactivity.<br />My real concern is that I think they took parts from the K40 and put them into the K55! Mine says K40 on the bottom, but the description, and look of the product is K55. A friend of the family got one store brought one for christmas so I will ask him what the bottom of his says.<br />Overall a child could set this thing up its super easy, and you get two filter which last two months each. You can buy them in bulk on Amazon as well.  I'm pursuing my Master's so this machine should come in handy during those late nights. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.

If you are looking for a solid, nice looking Keurig that accepts reuseable k-cups - this machine is for you.<br /><br />Here is the thing: I like a good cup of coffee. I mean a really good cup of coffee. One might even call me a coffee snob. And there is probably an episode of Portlandia inspired by coffee snobs like me. I like to think I could give Agent Cooper a run for his money.<br /><br />Does any of this sound like you? If so... DO NOT BUY A KEURIG!!!<br /><br />The main reason we bought this thing was because of the amount of coffee we'd end up pouring down the sink with our normal pot (the hubby and I are down to one cup a day). We thought buying a single-serve Keurig with reusable k-cups was the perfect solution. And maybe it is if you plan to use the pre-filled store-bought cups (not an option for us); however, the reusable k-cups by default make a super watered down cup of coffee. Bleck!<br /><br />After A TON of trial and error I've figured out a hack* to make a pretty good cup of coffee using local beans and the reusable k-cups. However, it was proceeded by a ridiculous amount of terrible cups of coffee first.<br /><br />Hindsight 20/20, I should have just stuck with the french press or bought a pour over.<br /><br />In sum: 3 stars for my experience, 4 or 5 stars for the actual product.<br /><br />* If you are interested in the hack I found, let me know and I can post a link here for you.",3,2017-07-04,3.0,True,,Awesome!

We use humidifiers in the house at times, and if we don't clean out the standing water from the humidifier, it leaves a disgusting pink film that I would not enjoy in my coffee.  The other issue I have is that every once and a while the coffee pours out all over the place, not in a nice stream.

They were either too loud, vibrated too much, or had the fill chamber in an inconvenient location or you had to completely remove the k-cup holder, dripping liquid everywhere.  Then I realized that the original Keurig machine was the standard by which all others are measured.  So I got the K55.  Everything is very convenient, easy to fill, very quiet (I have to look at the machine and make sure it is working, as it is so quiet).<br />Don't fall for the hype of getting something else.

And again, in less than 30 days, I was having problems. This time no matter how firmly I seated the water tank, it wouldn't recognize the tank as being connected. I gave up.
