It is obviously not the most expensive espresso maker one can buy, but, for the price, it's a great value. You cannot steam milk and brew espresso at the same time, as long as you work relatively quickly to assemble your drink, it's not a problem. It does not come with a tamper, but the scoop has a flat bottom that works fine for this purpose, no need to buy a tamper. I would recommend getting a stainless steel frothing pitcher, I tried with a number of pitchers I already owned, and none of them worked as well as the stainless steel version. Although I was never a Starbucks addict, if you are, this machine will pay for itself very quickly. After a couple of practice trials, I made lattes and espressos that taste better than what I can get at Starbucks. It does not take up very much counter space, which is a premium at our house.

There is no way it could produce a cup that strong.

Definitely do so and do not skip the priming section. There was one thing that had me super frustrated and it was that there is a orange little water stopper in the bottom of the water reservoir that is not mentioned in the instruction manual. You have to remove it! Otherwise the water will not go through. The only reason I found this out was because I called a representative. As soon as I took that off everything was working perfectly. I wish they would've mentioned that in the instructions because it would've saved me a lot of time as I am sure other people have had the same frustrations.

62,1,"I was surprised that this cheap little machine had higher ratings than so many more expensive models, so it seemed like a no-brainer.  It arrived last week and so far, I'm very impressed.  It makes good espresso and I'm especially impressed by how well it froths the milk.  Steaming milk tends to be a noisy process, but this machine is the quietest I've used.  It's also fast- I've typically started the milk in the microwave to speed up the process, but with this machine, it goes from fridge to frothy in only a couple minutes.  The foam is also robust enough that the caramel sits on top before it settles down, which is more difficult to accomplish with the skim milk I use. The only drawback I've found is that the espresso is a little slow to start brewing, but that could be a result of the filtered water I use right out of the fridge. Overall, it seems to be a very good little machine and you can't beat the small footprint on the counter- a definite plus if you have limited counterspace like me.<br /><br />An additional note- I haven't used plastic snap-on frothing tip yet, as I just haven't seen the need.  Just make sure you clean off the steam arm carefully after each use, as in the past, I've found that any residue that develops quickly becomes impossible to remove.

Just type ""Make cheap Mocha with a $30 Espresso Machine ECM250"".<br /><br />I read through the instructions and gave her a try for the first time jamming the steam wand down into a coffee mug of milk. Wow, haha - like some buyer mentioned in here about getting nothing but boiling milk was a true enough statement and burned myself along the way, my hands and fingers were splattered with boiling milk all over the place! Keep in mind, I've NEVER done this or even seen someone do it. Oh, and taking off the top without depressurizing it when I shouldn't was another learning curve, it burned my fingers AGAIN. Anyways, I couldn't get the micro-foam until I did some research and watched several videos on You Tube about how to do it. So, I tossed and turned about this my first night of ownership and woke with determination! Oh... did I earn some kisses from my bride when she was licking the spoon from a cup of Micro-Foam, and yes, from 2% milk, not whole milk as was mentioned in many of the videos to use.<br /><br />Micro-Foam:<br />I had ordered the 20oz Stainless Steel Frothing cup with a Temperature Gauge and proceeded to make it happen! Like me, if you don't know how to do this, you need a temp gauge. But, using a cold cup with cold milk about 10oz, half the container inserting the steaming wand all the way down and let it set, gently moving the cup up and down. When bubbles start, just put the wand in as deep as it will go. The steam wand IS short and close to the sides of the machine, but making do and using all my senses began to notice when the milk hits about 90 degrees a sweet spot begins form (funny sounding noise) that can be massaged until the temp hits 155 degrees tops. IMMEDIATELY take the brown wand extension off and drop it into some water, wipe the wand with a wet towel. Tap the mug on the counter if any large bubbles are present and whirl the frothing cup.<br /><br />Espresso:<br />I need some better grounds than pre-ground stuff.

Happy with every brew!<br /><br />Today, after removing the brew basket / filter holder from the machine to dump the used grounds, there was a piece of plastic screw head stuck in the grounds. Basically, we discovered they use a plastic screw to secure the strainer through which the water seeps into the grounds before dripping into your cup. Our screw head had snapped off, leaving the remainder of the screw stuck up in the machine. I immediately called the warranty number listed in the manual for assistance. I thought they might be able to send us a new plastic screw and we'd be good to go. Turns out, it's not an issue they feel is ""replaceable part-worthy,"" so they are sending us a brand new machine. So far, I'm pleased with the support we received and the ease of reporting the issue and getting it resolved. I was on the phone for maybe 5 minutes - total.

78,1,"I've been using the Krups espresso machine for the last 5 years.  It's been a great machine and definitely fulfilled my needs with coffee. However, one thing I wanted with a new espresso machine, was a milk steamer that worked and wouldn't break easily which is what would happen with my Krups machine.  I've learned to microwave my milk or buy a separate milk frother which has worked fine.  The reason I upgraded to the Mr. Coffee, was because a) I wanted a built in milk steamer and b), because I'm lazy, I wanted an apparatus that I didn't have to keep adding water to.  That's definitely something that I like about this machine: you fill the water canister in the back and you don't have to refill it until after a few uses, which is great.  Two things I don't like about this machine:<br />1) You can't just turn it on and forget about it and then come back to it a few minutes later and it has the right amount of espresso that you need.  You have to babysit it and then turn off the machine when you think you've brewed enough.  So, what's happening is that the espresso is actually a little too watery because I didn't turn it off at the right time.  That's annoying.<br />2) Though the milk steamer works, it doesn't froth the way I always hope an attached frother would.  I used to work in a restaurant and we made cappuccinos from time to time, and the steamer was just awesome.  Sure, my expectations are too high with frothing milk as I'm sure the machine the restaurant had was maybe a thousand dollars or close to.  Regardless, this is something I've come to terms with: I will never get a machine for less than $100 that will froth my milk the way I want it.",2,2017-01-02,3.0,True,,It's been a great machine and definitely fulfilled my needs with coffee,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

81,1,"Ah, the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista Espresso Maker is a lovely modern kitchen device. The instructions are very clear on how to prime the machine and how to make espresso, cappuccinos or lattes. So, why couldn't I get it to work right???<br /><br />I primed it twice, I kept pushing in the milk carafe, made sure milk was cold, let it cool off, tried again...After (4) tries I was about to give up. Luckily, my son found a little tube that had gone down the drain. It was a missing tube that helped with steaming the milk. The one thing I couldn't get to work! Apparently when I washed all the parts before priming the machine-unbeknownst to me, this little tube fell off.<br /><br />So, yes, the machine works beautifully. It's quick & easy. (if you don't lose any parts!) It is noisy, but that's to be expected with the steam. It doesn't take up too much room on the counter either.

112,1,"I purchased this Mr Coffee Espresso maker so many years ago (at least 5) that I can't remember exactly how many.  At a price of $60+ back then, I did not expect a lot.  I figured if it made decent coffee and lasted a year, I would have gotten my money's worth.  5 plus years later, the little machine is still going strong.  I give it 5 stars for quality and durability vis a vis a very low price for an espresso machine.  I have had much more expensive machines that have had the pump go out within a couple of years.  This machine makes good coffee with a nice foam on top.  The frother is not a strong point of the machine.  I found it did not steam sufficiently and after a few seconds would start putting out a jet of hot water rather than steam. The design of the steaming arm also makes it difficult to clean.  If I had an option of 4.5 stars I might ding it half a star for that.  However, since I am primarily an espresso and Americano drinker, I do not use the steaming arm much.  When I want a latte, I heat the milk separately in a pan like a grew up doing.  The coffee the machine makes is hot and very good with a nice foam on top.  I always pour a double or triple shot and it takes approximately 30 seconds for the machine to warm up and another 30 seconds to pour my very large shot.  I have never had a leakage problem as reported by others.  One item that might contribute to the machine's longevity is that we have a reverse osmosis filter on our tap and I only use that water to fill the tank.  Therefore, I've had very little problem with any mineral build up and I've had to clean the machine much less often than I would have to if using regular tap water.  If you are looking for a truly affordable, dependable, basic espresso maker, this is a great choice.",5,2018-09-04,,,,Great quality and durability for the price.,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

I bought this unit because I couldn't afford anything more expensive. Except for the rattle (which I fixed with some electrical tape), it paid for itself in a month. And I get to use any flavor I can find, not just the Starbucks flavors.<br /><br />Here's some advise for those giving it one or two stars: I clean mine about every six months with vinegar... just run a 16oz bottle through it multiple times. And I only use distilled water so the minerals don't build up in the system. I clean it after every use: blow the milk out of the steamer nozzle, then wipe it off (the metal tube), run a small amount of water through the brewing port to get the espresso gack out, and clean the espresso cup gasket EVERY TIME I USE IT. This keeps the rubber seal from breaking down.<br /><br />My machine has finally decided to call it quits. Since I got 8 years of service out of this baby, I'm going to buy another. Now I can afford the $300 machines, but why go with an unknown when I can stick with something that will give me another 8 years?",5,2015-08-10,5.0,,,I'd say that's a pretty good return on my investment,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
114,1,"Ok, I'm not a coffee drinker--never had a cup in my life. But when my healthy 13 year-old daughter craves for a white chocolate mocha latte and keeps getting rung up Starbucks for $4.25 a pop, I decided it was time to explore options. I bought this, Starbucks ground espresso, Starbucks vanilla syrup and went to work. Set up was very easy, even for this non-coffee drinking Keurig operator. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I prepared my daughter's favorite iced white chocolate mocha latte and put it into her Starbucks tumbler she uses at the retail stores and brought up to her in the morning, with a &#34;got you some Starbucks&#34; as I handed her the coffee.  She couldn't tell I made it.  Brought her down later to see the machine that was bought for her and showed her how I made--happy, happy, happy! Ten cups into this, the ECMP 1000 has been great. We bought a 12 oz pkg of SBUX coffee and a 12 oz. bottle of the syrup. It looks like we will get at least 30 cups of coffee from each. The coffee was $7.00, milk for 30 cups another $7 and the syrup was $6.00--I know I overpaid on the syrup. However, the point is 30 X $4.00 at retail is $120, less the $19 cost of ingredients get me a savings of around $100, or $3 per day. With one latte coffee drinker, the breakeven versus Starbucks retail is around 40 days; 2 drinkers in your house brings the break even down to 20 days.Besides the economic slam-dunk, here are somes pros and cons.<br />Pros:<br />Simple to use, push buttons for large and small varieties of espresso, cappuccino and latte.<br />Easy to put together<br />No paper filters<br />Comes with everything you need to brew<br />Milk reservoir unplugs and can be refrigerated.<br /><br />Cons (very picky list here):<br />Would like a separate one-button milk-only froth button (can be done with this unit, but I want a separate button-LOL)<br />The filter handle, once the espresso is in the filter and is being tightened into the holder is VERY tight--feels like I could break the handle. Even with level espresso in filter. Advice: use 90-95%% of filter capacity to reduce tightness to lock in filter.<br />Getting the right cup to fit in the drip zone is a little tricky because my 16 oz coffee mug barely fit and after a single shot latte, the froth is just over the edge of my mug I use to collect the latte before pouring it on the ice in a tumbler.

115,1,"This espresso maker is great for the price. I have had this machine for almost two years now and it is still working great. There are a few tips I would like to share. A burr grinder is a must. The best setting on my Capresso grinder is the very first ""extra fine"" setting just in between ""fine"" and ""extra fine."" Next, pack the coffee in the filter fairly well. This takes some practice, too packed makes the coffee not come out. I would throw out the small filter and use only the large. When I make a 16 oz or 20 oz coffee, I use two large filter fulls. For the frothing, I like to warm my milk in the microwave for one minute before I use the frother. Let the frother spit out a bit of steam for a second. The frothing takes a while. I set it there and go brush my teeth and come back and it is about done. I did take the rubber piece off to try to keep it a bit more sanitary. Sometimes milk will dry in the hole and you just unscrew it and poke it with a tooth pick. Some people have noted the rubber seal on the water tank going bad and leaking water. I have only taken my water container off a hand full of times and I have not had any problem. I pour water into it with a cup. It takes a minute to make my coffee; however, I think my coffee tastes better than a coffee shops.

Most reviews are typically done after receiving the product and using it for a short time.  We've owned this one and used it at least once a day for the past 16 months and during that time have not plugged in our Keurig.<br />I like it.  It heats up pretty quickly and with the right ingredients and proper grind of coffee you can make a latte, cappuccino or whatever else you'd like that will taste like what you can get at Caribou, Starbucks or other spendy/trendy coffee locations.  The kids like it since they can heat up milk only for their hot chocolates.  It has multiple settings so you can get a two pre-programmed amounts for espresso, cappuccino or latte or you can use the &#34;manual&#34; setting and get more or less if you'd like.

There was a period of time that it seemed to not work well as if the pump was going out but after observing it for a while these events only happened during the heating of milk. I took the entire milk container apart and cleaned it thoroughly - all internal tubes and valve.  Determined that since we store the container in the fridge with remaining milk over a period of time milk scum was building up.  Bottom line: keep it clean.<br />To date it is still going strong. I like that it has an internal timer and will shut off if not used for some time.  Press a button on front and it turns back on and wait a little bit for it to heat back up.

120,1,"I got this for Christmas and after using it several times a day since then, I can tell you that this is a wonderful espresso maker and there's nothing in the $100-$1000 machines I'd find worth the extra money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Steam is the only way to make proper coffee or espresso. Other methods don't produce the smooth, rich taste of a real espresso. In fact, it wasn't until the 1940s that added pressure and lower temperatures were used in espresso machines; this was not done to make a better espresso, but to make it cheaper and have a larger amount of foam on top (the crema). The hot water doesn't extract the oils in the same way as steam, so if you're using hot water, you're not making a true espresso. And for those who've written reviews saying this kind of espresso machine can't make a decent crema, check out the pictures I've posted (using Lavazza Super Crema).<br />- Milk frother runs from the same reservoir you're making the espresso with; only one heating element, no second reservoir to fill and check, and no delay between finishing the espresso and starting the frothing.<br />- Everything you need is in the box. The coffee scoop has a flattened bottom for use as a tamper (not the best, see below) but it will do for a while; the other end of the coffee scoop is the wrench you'll need to removing the frothing arm for cleaning.<br />- Actually faster than my single-cup drip machine. If I want a 12-oz coffee with a double shot of espresso, the espresso machine, even having to make steam, finishes before the coffee maker gets done. Considering that both are starting from room-temperature water, I think this is wonderfully fast.<br />- The Mr. Coffee customer service is top notch. I had a problem with the decanter lid and they took care of it quickly and courteously.<br />- If you fill the basket to the first notch but use 4 cups (8 oz) of water, you'll get a really nice cup of what I'd call American coffee. It will still have the richness of good espresso because the steam will get all the different oils out of the grounds, but it will be less strong with no crema or aftertaste.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Pretty long cool-down time. The best thing to do here, if you have the time, is to wait about five minutes after you've made the espresso, turn the selector to froth and let the pressure escape for a couple seconds, then remove the reservoir top; this will let the reservoir cool down faster.<br />- Going anywhere over 3 shots (6 oz) will destroy the crema; there's just too much steam coming out too close to the top of the liquid for any foam to survive.<br />- This is related to the first two, actually putting the two together. It's hard to use this if you want to prepare espresso for a lot of people, say at a party or holiday dinner. If this really is a big concern, at this price, buy two. I'm serious...for less than the price of the fancy machines that don't do anything more than this one you can buy a couple of these to keep the drinks flowing.<br /><br />Suggestions:<br />- Buy a good tamper, it will make a lot of difference. I use&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-49mm-Espresso-Tamper-Stainless-Steel-Coffee/dp/B000BU7TSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red 49mm Espresso Tamper Stainless Steel Coffee</a>&nbsp;and am very happy with the results.<br />- Remember to always release the pressure through the frothing arm before removing the reservoir lid. This applies even if you've steamed milk because there always seems to be a pressure difference after the machine cools down.<br /><br />I just want to clear one thing up that I'm sure is just a typo on the Amazon page but some people might be unsure of. This will not make 20 ounces of coffee per use. Where the page says, ""Steam espresso machine brews 1 to 4 cups (20 ounces)"" it almost certainly means to say, ""Steam espresso machine brews 1 to 4 cups (2.0 ounces per cup).""<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />Buy this espresso maker.",5,2011-01-30,125.0,,,"Don't spend a penny more, this is a wonderful espresso maker.","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

151,1,"We've found this espresso machine to make fairly decent espresso and cappuccino. Our particular unit is a bit noisy - the pump makes a sound that resembles a fog horn. It's not awful, but can be annoying if there are bedrooms located near the kitchen and people are still sleeping while the coffee is being prepared by early risers. For those who are seafarers and are using this on board a sailing vessel, however, this sound can be very useful during times of fog and heavy mist. Design-wise it would be nice to have all of the controls on the front of the unit. Having the power switch and brew/steam control on the right side requires a bit more room on that side of the machine to access these. Again, this is not awful, but for those with very limited counter space - such as a galley on the aforementioned sailing vessel - this can be an issue. The reservoir has ample capacity for a machine this size. It can be helpful to have a light source near the unit for easier viewing of the water level in the reservoir without having to remove it. While there have been a few detractors with this machine for our family, it has been a good espresso and cappuccino maker overall, especially within this price range.",4,2016-10-26,3.0,True,,"Good espresso, especially for seafarers.","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

Two, no pitcher and three, no tamper.  I received this as a gift from my Wish List.  I chose this maker for the price, manufacturer and majority of the ratings.  I am not displeased and was aware of the missing pitcher and tamper, henceforth the inclusion of them on my Wish List.  I had trouble getting the steamer to work.  I believe it was because the tube was clogged with built up milk residue, since I did get steam the first two times.  That would put excessive force on the screw cap on the top.  Also, if the grounds aren't screwed in tightly and the coffee is tamped down too firmly, it could blow off breaking the coffee pot.  I believe this has been the cause of the ""explosions"".  Either way, I will surely be carefull.  This may be inheirent with any expresso maker.  I still haven't been able to make a decent latte, though cappuccinos have been easy.  Practice is the key, I'm sure.  The individual who stated his cleaning and pre-steam method was wise.  I will follow his method for sure.  $40 is a fair price for this maker and I would recommend it for the beginner or those not too critical of their result.",3,2012-01-01,,,,Mr. Coffee Express Maker,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
153,1,"IN DEPTH REVIEW:<br /><br />We have owned the earlier version of this same model for almost two years. I am going to list the pros and cons for you so as you can make a a choice of whether or not this is the machine for you.<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />It functions well  and have not had a problem with the pump or steamer not working. Occasionally, you might need to unclog the steam wand with a toothpick. But this happens with any machine where the steam port is very small. I have had to descale the machine once so far. I used 100% white vinegar and filled it to the top and left it overnight. Ran it through 3-4 times with water and Presto!<br /><br />It is a very economically priced machine. The prior model which I have (looks almost identical, except this one has a slightly more polished look) was slightly less expensive. Around $29.99.<br /><br />The steam wand produces good quality steamed/frothed milk. However, this is somewhat on the users end as this is mainly achieved through proper technique. But it does do the job.<br /><br />Cons: For true espresso and cappuccino fans out there such as myself, it is important to note that this machine does not make a true espresso. It makes strong coffee and works well for those that are not after a true espresso which has a golden cream layer on the top referred to as crema. This only results from using the proper machine and grinding the coffee precisely to make espressos. But the machine does turn out quality coffee drinks for the average coffee lover.<br /><br />As with most inexpensive models, you can only run one function at a time. You can brew the espresso or steam milk. This is the case with most in home machines so I was not disappointed. This was expected, but I would love to be able to operate both functions at once. Also, with inexpensive models, it is almost entirely made of plastic with no chrome accents. For the price, it is a great machine non the less.<br /><br />For the cost of this machine, it is a great machine. One thing I love about it is that it works! I have read reviews on more expensive machines but still in a moderate price range (under $100.00) with pumps going bad in under a year. Mine is a few years old and has shown no signs of mechanical failure. Does it make a true espresso? No...but it does a great job and let's be honest. A machine in this price range is not targeted to espresso aficionados. It's target market is for coffee lovers of all types who are budget minded.

I will caution that you make sure you put everything on tight and well-aligned. I've had two problems with it and both are user error - once I screwed the water resevoir cap on at the wrong angle, so things weren't sealed, and steam escaped through the top; the second time I didn't get the grounds holder in correctly and it caused a lot of steam and coffee grounds to go everywhere.

156,1,"This machine works ok. I've had it 3 or 4 years. No crema as stated in other reviews. I've done the descaling with vinegar...not helpful. Bought a product specifically for coffee/espresso makers, works better. The frothing wand on my machine is different than pictured, maybe because it's an older model? The instructions call for cleaning the frothing wand in a manner that I cannot physically do based on the difference  in my frothing wand. The frothing wand is hard to keep clean, but I try my best. Sometimes it won't froth the milk, not sure why. The scoop/tamper is not really a good tamper. I need to buy another one that will work better. I get decent espresso with it, although if I want to brew 4 espresso shots and then froth milk I don't think there's enough water left, so I'd have to let the machine cool down before being able to put in more water, then brew more espresso (or at least run water through the brew cycle I guess) to heat up the machine to froth milk. Maybe a manual frother like shown in the Rok video would help. Having trouble finding a cheap frothing cup to go with this cheap machine...would hate to have to buy a frothing cup that cost more than the machine!

159,1,"Mr Coffee espresso maker review<br />About 22 years ago I used to own a Krups espresso maker. It was temperamental and expensive, but it made a great cup of coffee. Many moves and years later, I've lost my old espresso maker along the way. After reading the reviews about this espresso maker, I decided to give it a shot. I've now had it for about 2 months and I *LOVE* this little guy! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!<br />Price - Cheap! I don't mean quality, I mean you get a very nice machine for a very low price. I paid over $80 for my Krups 22 years ago. This espresso machine is less than half that price and works a lot better.<br />Ease of use - relatively easy. Look, you're dealing with a small machine with a lot of pressure. You do have to exercise some caution, like relieving the pressure before you try to open the reservoir. There are a few points on 'ease of use' that I would also like to point out:<br /> -Reservoir lid can be slippery. There is no grippage, no knobbbyness, nothing to grab onto. Plus it's angled upwards, in a cone shape. What the heck guys? The reservoir is under pressure during use. Why would you create the lid to be slippery and make it cone shaped? It can be difficult to handle if your hands are wet. Just be careful when you're relieving the pressure and you should be good.<br /> -The slot where the coffee filter assembly is awkward. I don't know what you call the thing, but trying to insert your coffee filter assembly into the machine can be tricky. It's in the middle of the machine and it has to be lined up just right. Couldn't someone have made this a little (a LOT) easier to line up?<br /> -Frothing aid is useless! That rubber black thing on the end of the frother? What's up with that? Chuck it. My old krups had something similar on it. I had a hard time frothing milk until I chucked it. So straight out of the box, I didn't even bother with it, just removed it and chucked it!<br />Having said my few points of contention with this machine, overall it is a very easy to use machine, well made, brews FAST, and makes a very tasty cup of espresso or latte. Unlike my old krups, you can make multiple carafes by relieving the pressure and refilling the reservoir between brews. And it's quiet! Maybe too quiet. I kind of miss all the weird whistling, bubbling, and clouds of steam my old krups put out. I was always on the edge of my seat wondering if today I'd get a good cup of coffee or get blown to smithereens.<br />Oh, one last thing- Don't be fooled by the name. I was cautious about buying the brand. It's a bit of joke, right? The same company that grandpa used to make his cruddy coffee is now making espresso makers... I mean, what do they know about *GOOD* espresso? Apparently, quiet a bit! BUY the MR COFFEE ESPRESSO MACHINE!<br /><br />*** update: I've now had this espresso machine for 9 months.

It's not a big deal, it gets me out of my chair.<br /><br />One night, I see this in Wal Mart one night with my wife. $37 or thereabouts. She buys it (and a tin of coffee, some whipped cream, some hershey's chocolate syrup, and a gallon of milk). All told, maybe $55. The tin of coffee looks like it will be good for 100 cups or so, really, the ingredients for a ""venti"" probably are in the range of 50 to 75 cents, at the very highest.

It works better than DeLonghi EC155 which cost twice as much and it is fairly idiot proof once you know how to use it.  I had visitors who'd never made espresso before making my morning latte for me.  Normally I get stuck with coffee duty every morning. Sweet.<br /><br />It actually seems to make better espresso with a coarser grind which is fine since you have the choice, if grinding at the store, to make regular coffee or espresso with the same coffee.<br /><br />My only complaint are the buttons and knobs.  The front buttons set the pressure (different for steam vs espresso) and the knob on the right is a valve that directs the pressurized steam to either making espresso or the milk foamer.  The buttons love to blink green in different patterns and no one who approaches this machine initially has any clue what this means.  Since I rent my home out on AirBnB I made a Youtube video on how to use this thing so I wouldn't have to teach people how to use it all the time.<br /><br />Some reviews mention the longevity is poor, but if I have to replace it every year, it still saves money.

I like that I can control the amounts that are made during the brew and froth, as I like a double shot of espresso with only a single Latte's portion of steamed milk.

If you have decent beans you will have a great brew with beautiful crema every time.<br /><br />Only advice I can give you (if you are just starting out with good coffee) is go with a good Burr Grinder at the same time you get this.

If you use oversized cups like we do, then you have to use the large setting and sometimes after it's done run another small cup to fill it completely, but that's no problem as the pressure extracts every last bit of flavor from your coffee grounds. There's no need to refill the cup with more grounds even when making two cups!  It's squarish design fits neatly on the counter top and the milk chamber cleans easily just by rinsing out and putting it back.

A great tasting coffee with nice froth all in one machine. Just perfect!! I imagined a bright future for our family and this machine.<br /><br />Were it not that after one week, the water reservoir started leaking from the bottom plug. I tried with a little tape, but it just leaked more and more. So after a week of great coffee and a second week of great coffee and small water disasters I sent it back for another one.<br />I assumed this was a monday-morning product and the next one would be better. And the next machine was better!! That is, for three weeks. Then it slowly started to leak just like the first machine. DARN!

I figured the machine to be a pretty decent bargain even so; at the low price, getting a few months of use out of it is pretty solid! Also, as a former barista, I figured people probably just abused the machine and that's why they ceased to function.<br /><br />OH, HOW SNOOTY AND NAIVE I WAS.<br /><br />The FIRST time I tried to use the machine, it kept flashing both the red and green lights, which--as several other reviewers can tell you--meant I was unable to use any function of the machine. I reread the manual, made sure every piece was in the proper place, unplugged it and turned it on/off a few times. Finally the red light remained solid (to indicate it was powered on) and the green light went from blinking to solid after the machine warmed up. And I was able to make a single cappuccino! I'll remember fondly that single brush with victory. How fleeting it was...<br /><br />Then I tried to use it again later in the day, and the steam wand stopped in the middle of steaming a few ounces of milk. The red and green lights began blinking again. This time, no amount of unplugging or turning off/on would work.<br /><br />Back in the box it goes, to be returned to Amazon. I'm very disappointed. I knew I was in for a cheap machine that would die fairly soon--but I thought I could get more than a single use out of it!<br /><br />Also, if you decide to purchase this (for god knows what reason) and are going to steam milk with the steaming wand--make sure your pitcher is tiny. No more than 12oz, for sure. I purchased a 16oz pitcher because I wanted a roomy pitcher since I like to create a lot of foam. But the wand is only three inches long or so, and very underpowered.

272,1,"I'm saving so much money with this espresso/latte maker and the drinks taste (almost) as good. This machine can pull excellent espresso shots; as good as a much more expensive machine. The milk frother -- not so much. But, I can make a double cafe mocha for less than a dollar! And when I want to get &#34;fancy&#34;, I can do the drink manually by first pouring the frothed milk into a pitcher, then pull the espresso shots into my mug. Then, tamp/stir the milk and pour it into the espresso. Can't do latte art, but the drink tastes great!<br /><br />Suggestions after several months of use:<br />1. Let the machine heat up with the (empty) portafilter in place and the mug on top for 15 minutes if you have time. Get everything nice and hot. Just note that the portafilter will get VERY hot. Nothing worse than a lukewarm latte.<br />2. Keep the milk ice cold until you're ready to froth it. This will keep the hard sticky foam to a minimum.<br />3. Use freshly-ground beans if you have a grinder. I'm using pre-ground because I don't have a grinder and the coffee has lost its oil after a few weeks and no longer makes a nice thick crema.<br />4. For the best results (if you have time), pull the espresso and the milk separately as I mention above. This gives you control over the milk content and allows you to &#34;work&#34; the milk a little to remove the big bubbles before adding it to the drink.<br />5. Keep the whole machine as clean as possible including the milk container, hoses, spouts, filters and trays. Milk and coffee build up if you don't.<br />6. Go ahead and buy a real tamper.

Once the plastic cover over the steamer is removed coffee tastes great. So far, after many-many uses, the steamer remains clear and doesn't leave a bad taste. Barista trick: run the steam through the steamer without any milk to get a thorough clean, then take a hot towel/rag and remove any dried milk. In addition, I thought the steamer moved but it is in a fixed position. No big deal but definitely that would be nice for future models. It also took a few tries to get a good temperature for milk. I highly suggest a metal milk cup for steaming this way you can feel when the milk is hot, no thermometer needed. Takes about 1-2 mins to reach a comfortable/hot temperature.

The operation is simple and the front of the machine has icons that I would hope anyone can follow. I can.<br />2.  It makes a very good cuppa whatever you want. Maybe not for the gourmet, but it does it for me.<br />3.  The price is great.<br />There were some problems with what filter came with the machine. Instead of the promised two there was only one and Mr. Coffee is going through some kind of a transition with whether they will include the double shot filter. I called and they sent what I needed but only after asking for a supervisor.<br />I make chai tea latte's often and this is a great machine for that. I simply grind my loose tea finer and put it in the filter and treat it like latte from there! Rooibos, Assam and chai spices all make a great drink.<br />Finally, the machine has cleaning modes for both the milk container and the espresso filter.

However, it doesn’t brew consistent cups! I have not had this machine for more than two months and only use distilled water. The first week, my cups were perfect. After the first week, the lattes are not consistently sized. Sometimes a lot of milk comes out and cry little espresso. Sometimes the opposite occurs. Sometimes the proportions seem correct, but both are smaller or larger amounts than usual. Sometimes my cup is half full and sometimes it overflows! It’s a hassle to have to manually brew the espresso and milk, especially since I bought this machine for the convenience of being able to push a button and walk away, come back and my coffee is done. I’m very disappointed about this. It wouldn’t be as bad if the proportions of milk to espresso were always consistent, just the amount in total was different.

I thought I was tamping too hard. Today I went to pull a shot and nothing came out. I took the brew basket out and there was a lot of pressure buildup, water/coffee ground splatter. Now all of the lights are blinking and won't go off. I unplugged the unit and waited and it is still doing it. I am soooooo upset at this. I really liked this machine, and it took only a little over a month for it to break. I'm pretty sure it's too late to return it! NOOOO!!<br /><br />Previous post:<br />I have been practicing latte art with it for about a month now (still have yet to master). They make it look so easy. I took off the black frothing attachment because it just gets in the way and the froth can't be done as well.<br />Only thing I wish is that after brewing my espresso shot I didn't have to turn the unit off and back on in order to go from brewing to steaming buttons. I wish you could easily switch from one to the other. The steam wand also takes around 10 seconds to prime up, so my shot starts to get a little cold. I brew my shot, then immediately turn it off, back on, and press the steam button to charge it so it's ready.<br /><br />BUT...for the price, it is great. It's my first espresso machine and am happy with the purchase. Just takes a little bit of getting used to how to make your coffee right with it if you're looking to do latte's or cappuccinos, but I won't be as sad if this ever breaks because of the affordable price.",3,2015-12-28,17.0,True,,Works great!

280,1,"I bought this as an experiment to see whether we could cut down on our trips to the boutique coffee shops.  It has more than met my expectations.  Espresso machines are tricky to use, and it does take some time and effort to come up with a single or double shot beverage, but once you get the hang of it, it's kind of fun and you get to enjoy the results of your efforts.<br /><br />This is a manual machine, so you control the flow.  It's designed to make a 2oz double shot from 14g of coffee, but you have to stop the flow when you've accumulated 2oz.  The machine continues to pump water through the grounds as long as the knob is turned to brew.  I still need to find a quick and easy way to know when I've reached the 2oz mark, so get some espresso cups or a small measuring container to get this right.<br /><br />Likewise for the milk.  Frothing and heating is totally under your control with the steam knob.  I have an instant read pen thermometer that lets me know when the milk has reached the right temperature, which I highly recommend.<br /><br />When you're done, there's a lot of cleanup, but do that after you've enjoyed your beverage.  You need to keep the machine clean to keep it in working order.  I've read some reviews that complain about leaks and wonder if they don't understand how the brew process ends.  Once you've completed your brew, the machine needs to dump the pressure from the brewing process.  It accomplishes this by venting steam into the bottom drip tray.  This puts quite a bit of water into the tray at the end, so you have to dump and dry this after each use.  If you don't, it will eventually overflow through no fault of its own.<br /><br />In the end, you'll have to decide whether it's easier for you to head to the drive-through for your caffeine fix, but if you want to make decent espresso and cappuccino at home after that special dinner, this is a great reasonably priced way to do it and to impress your guests with your barista expertise.",5,2017-02-01,4.0,True,,Great little espresso maker,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

If you do have the money, go for the Breville one. Otherwise, this is a great alternative. It does tend to be VERY loud when brewing, but I'm okay with it.

373,1,"I've always been a huge espresso fanatic and would usually start out my days with a double shot of espresso. My obsession started when I worked as a barista at an Italian restaurant. I wanted to produce the same quality espresso at home so being on a budget, I purchased the EMCP10 in 2005. The machine was great and would produce a great cup of espresso every time with just the right amount of crema. The pump died out last week and I went to Target to purchase the ECMP50.<br /><br />I took my new machine home ready to feed my caffeine addiction (at this point I've been deprived of espresso for about a week). I set the machine up and filled the water tank to the ""max"" mark. So far, so good. I turned the machine on to let it warm up so that I could run some water through it and get it nice and clean. I step out of the room for no more than 2 minutes and when I return my counter is flooded with water. I look at my machine and the water tank is empty!! ""Ok.."" I think to myself. ""Maybe I put the tank on the wrong way?"". I fiddle around for another 20 minutes and realize that water is leaking out of the bottom of the machine (where the power cord feeds into the machine) and might cause a serious problem down the road (Morning Headline: Man found electricuted hunched over his coffee maker). Still wearing my jacket I throw the machine back into the box and head back to Target. The customer service lady said that was the third machine that was returned for the same problem this month (I noticed alot of the negative complaints were also individuals who had the leaking problem AND purchased the machine from Target. Perhaps a bad batch?). I give it another shot, crossing my fingers and hoping that the machine I got was just a bad apple and I do an exchange as opposed to a refund.<br /><br />I get home and open up the box. Right away I could tell this wasn't the original packaging. There were also watermarks in the water tank as well as a few espresso grinds here and there. Now i'm thinking that this machine was probably one of the returns that Target recieved or it was a refurbished model. Either way, I decide to give this bad boy another spin. I do the same setup, fill up the tank, clean the machine and I'm ready to brew my first cup. I used illy coffee (a bit pricey but worth it), used my trusty tamper and set the machine up to brew. I cross my fingers and low and behold, rich crema! I time the pull and it took about 20 seconds... perfect. This $70 machine ($69.99 on sale at Target) produced a cup of espresso comparable to something you would get from a $3,000 machine (without all the bells and whistles of course).<br /><br />The machine itself looks sleak and elegant. Controls are easy to use. When your actually handling the machine it seems a bit cheap because of all the plastic components.

378,1,"I was leary about a MrCoffe product that could produce acceptable espresso drinks. First it was so cheap and the brand has a low end reputation. Being strapped for cash pretty much excluded anything over $100 bucks so after much research I decided to try the Mr Coffee ECMP50, knowing that I could return it if it under delivered. After the first cup through the machine, I was totally blown away by the performance of the machine and would recommend this to anyone who wants a machine capable of making first rate espresso.<br /><br />Now the details: I purchased my first pump espresso machine in the late 80's, a Krups machine styled a lot like the Mr Coffee and many others these days. The first one worked hard everyday for several years and was replaced with another which did fine service for many more. Kind of got the caffeine shakes and decided to lay off coffee for quite a few years. Came back to java this year and picked this one up.<br /><br />First thing I did was rip the rubber thing off the steamer. Many years ago they started adding these things to make it easier for some to make decent foam and steam. If you master the steaming technique you don't need this thing and it made it harder for me. You have to learn when and how and where to place tip into the milk. It takes awhile to get it right everytime but once you get it, it is like riding a bike. Like I said my very first cup from this machine was perfect as well as the steamed frothy milk.<br /><br />Somewhere I read the machine has 15 bars and it has plenty of power. You find this out when you have the grind maybe a bit too fine or you tamped a bit too much. A strong machine will push through to the end but may slow down but it will get the job done. This one does that just fine.<br /><br />Bars also deliver the steam pressure and this one has plenty. It actually has such force you had better have the tip fully immersed in the liquid before flipping the switch as you will not be able to do it once any steam emerges due to immediate strong force. One thing which would be nicer is a rotary variable valve for delivering the steam incrementally. If you are moving fast, you can get the steamer moving toward the steam tip while starting to turn the value on and manually give it the full power once you got the tip in the liquid. This machine you have to get the tip in, then flip the steamer on. This is clearly a finer point in the use of the machine not the final result.<br /><br />The machine gets ready in an amazingly short timeframe. I have not timed it but it must be no more than about 20-30 seconds and it is ready to go. By the time you grab the coffee and load it up, the machine is waiting for you to get that cup under there and go. Steaming takes a bit longer but it is still quite acceptable. What I do is as soon as the coffee is done, hit the steam button then go fetch the milk and put in the steamer cup. Stick the tip in and the machine will be ready to steam.<br /><br />The machine is made cheaply, no getting around that. Lots of plastic and thin brushed metal. It certainly feels cheapish so if you want something with authority and status on the kitchen counter, look elsewhere. The machine makes a fair bit of noise, rattles while warming up and shakes enough to jiggle and move the cups from under the stream if not totally level. This can send some elsewhere but it is consistent with its exterior appearance. I may place a mouse pad underneath it and I suspect that will dampen the vibration and sound as well as level it up. Maybe putting a few sticky rubber feet will solve it too. Again, this has no effect on the quality of the espresso.<br /><br />Filling the reservoir could not be simpler. Just lift the back and up it pops to get refilled. Our machine is located near the sink which has a pull out flex hose so we just pull it over the top of the machine and fill it up without removing it. Also the volume is good and you get many pulls before refilling.<br /><br />Cleanup is really simple. Just a slight tilt of the tray and it slides out for easy dumping. Make sure to empty it sooner rather than later since once it is full, that slight tilt will splash water. Also, make sure to take a rag now and then and gently clean around the O-ring and mesh where the water comes out.<br /><br />The only really serviceable part on this one like my old Krups is a rubber O-ring that seals the coffee holder. It will wear out at some point but no big deal to replace.<br /><br />The only thing which remains a mystery is the internals and how well they will hold up over time. There really isn't too much too these things other than a thermo plate to heat the water, a thermostat, and a few values to control the flow of water and steam. But who knows. I just plan top keep the receipt and if it fails to perform prematurely, go get another under warranty.<br /><br />All in all, this is an amazing machine and a super cheap price if your primary goal is to produce a first class cap or espresso. Honestly, if you have all your technique mastered and use good beans, you can produce on par with the best. It will rattle and look cheap and who know how long it will last but for the cost of buying 20 cups down the street it is a no brainer.",5,2010-04-03,2.0,,,Super value - Super performance,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

381,1,"So I've had this machine for over a year and I still love it. When I first bought it I did a lot of research and felt that the cons for this machine were not too bad.  Like many of the other reviews I discovered that the reservoir would occasionally leak, especially after filling it up.  After a while and the machine continuing to leak I finally figured out why!!!  In the resvoir, where the lid attaches there are 2 thin slots (its the area that allows the lid to slide up).  When I was pouring the water in (I don't remove the reservoir when i fill it), I wasn't really paying attention to how I was pouring it, and realized that if you pour water over the slots, then it is not going inside the reservoir, making it appear that it is leaking.  I understand that some of you may have actual leaks, but if your machine only leaks when you add water, then this is probably your problem as well.  Just make sure you pour it in carefully or remove the reservoir altogether to fill it.  I don't expect this to solve all the leakage problems, but if it helps a couple of you then I've done my work.<br /><br />In general, this is a great machine, especially for the money.  I have had it for over a year and make two lattes for myself a day (plus i make a lot for others) so I would say i have used it almost 1,000 times.  Like others have said read the directions carefully, and you'll get used to the machine quickly.  The most important part is to use the red switch to turn the machine off.  I once used one of the buttons or the dial to turn it off and broke it.  The good news is that Mr. Coffees repair service was great.  The biggest pain was that I had to drive about 30 minutes to bring it to a specific place for them to send it out, but I didn't have to pay anything, not even shipping, and I had a brand new unit sent to me in about a week!<br /><br />Great product, and I would buy another in a second.",5,2011-08-19,2.0,,,I FOUND OUT WHY MINE LEAKS!!!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

404,1,"UPDATE 02/10/2017<br />Well, about 2 weeks after my original review the machine started to leak slightly. Initially I thought it was from the drain tube going into the tray after steaming, it was not. It started out as about 1/4 cup of water, and has progressively gotten worse. This morning I went to make my morning coffee and the machine went crazy. It now does not make coffee at all, instead it makes the noise like the pump is running and dumps the entire tank full of water all over the counter. Sorry folks, but for daily or multiple cups a day, this machine simply can't hold up it seems. I'll be spending an extra few dollars and getting the De'Longhi 155 today. Really wish it was a different story, but this thing is no good.<br /><br />I want to start this review by saying that I am a hardcore coffee snob, but I also do not see the need to spend hundreds to make a good espresso. As such, I took a shot at this machine, and I must say that I am really really impressed.<br /><br />The quality of the build on this machine is pretty impressive, the accessories that come with it are usable, and the fill tank is an absolute dream. Since buying this machine I have made easily over 100 shots from it, and I haven't had a single problem. If you grind right this machine will produce an excellent espresso with a nice thick crema. My wife does lattes with this machine every morning and loves it. It does have a lower end steam wand, but it works perfectly to make micro and macro foam depending on the drink. I also really like the basket on the top, and the drip tray is perfect. Priming on this machine takes nearly no time compared to others I have owned as well.<br /><br />The only complaints I have about this machine are the vibration and steam feature. However, it seems the more I use the machine, the more the vibration has decreased. It's no longer so bad it rattles my cup off the drip tray, so that is a plus. For the steam, it just seems there's not a lot of customization on the flow etc. You switch the knob to steam and it is steaming, if you try to turn the knob back a bit it will stop steaming and go into the cleaning cycle. A minor irritation, but an irritation nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall I am happy to give this machine 5 out of 5 stars based on the price and the quality you get for that price.

It has a great rating, which IMO is a huge selling point for any product. Unfortunately, it's just OKAY...<br /><br />The main reason it's a 3, not 4 star rating is that the WATER RESERVOIR LEAKS!!! If filled to the the max level, which is what should be intended, the bottom &#34;seal&#34; appears to be overwhelmed by the weight of the water and it starts to slowly leak everywhere...

423,1,"This was my first espresso machine. I wanted something cheap in case I turned out to be terrible at making it and the reviews convinced me it was worth a shot. I'm so happy I bought this; after getting a tamper, a frothing pitcher, a grinder, and some syrups, I was in business and now I have fresh lattes whenever I want, for a fraction of the price I was paying at the store. It really only takes me about 5-7 minutes to grind the beans (by hand!), brew the espresso, steam the milk, and assemble my drink, so it's a time saver, too. I was nervous from some of the other reviews, but it's been working very well for me. I disassemble and clean it after every use, which only takes a minute.<br /><br />It took me a while to learn how to steam the milk properly. I tried it with and without the plastic &#34;frothing aid,&#34; or whatever it's called in the description, and I definitely get better results without it. The frothing wand is very short, which means you need to choose your frothing pitcher carefully; I have a 12 oz one that I usually fill with 5-6 oz of milk and it works well. I can submerge the wand, the milk has room to move, and I have enough room to get the amount of foam I like at the end.<br /><br />Great beginner's model!",5,2013-02-04,2.0,True,,"Has a learning curve, but worth it","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

As long as you take care to clean it after each use and give it a good detailing every so often, it will work like a charm!<br /><br />Here is my routine - I hope it helps someone out!<br /><br />1. Fold a paper towel and put it on the counter. Take the small espresso basket out of the holder and put it on the paper towel. Fill with desired amount of espresso, and tamp - not too hard! (ps., do you have a Misto olive oil sprayer? Turn it upside down and use that to tamp. Your welcome. :p) Make sure the edges are clean and place in the holder. Use paper towel to wipe tamp-er. Lock the holder into the espresso machine.<br /><br />2. Using glass carafe, fill espresso machine with desired amount of water. (I generally make a latte, so I fill it with enough to make the espresso and steam too!) Put the lid on the carafe and slide into place. Do not screw the top on yet!!<br /><br />3. Plug in the espresso machine *with the screw-top off* and turn to 'brew'. If you're steaming milk, take out the milk and pour into steaming cup. Set on the counter.<br /><br />4. Once the water starts to make noise and is about to be or already boiling, quickly screw the top into place. This method ensures that no yucky warm water filters through the espresso and weakens it/changes the flavor. Since this little guy just works off of steam pressure, screwing the cap on when the steam really starts is the best way to avoid this. Be a bit careful, by the way.<br /><br />5. While the espresso is brewing, I like to put my sugar in the mug beforehand. Remember that paper towel? Wet it. Once the espresso starts to change color or the machine makes a slightly different noise, get your milk ready, stick the nozzle in, and steam. I won't go into the method... You'll figure out what works for you! Once you're done steaming, use the wet paper towel to immediately wipe down the steam nozzle.<br /><br />6. Pour your espresso into the mug, followed by your milk/foam. Fill the milk steaming cup with water and re-insert the nozzle. I rest the cup on top of another upside down mug so that I don't have to hold it. Now unplug the machine, turn the nozzle to steam, and let the rest of the steam out into the water. This will release the pressure as well as cleaning the nozzle!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />My only complaint about this machine is the position of the steaming nozzle.

479,1,"This machine works pretty good. Unless you're a real stickler you're not gonna hate what comes out of this. Is it 100% authentic coffeehouse espresso? No. But it gets pretty close especially once you get the technique down. It is definitely better than when Starbucks has an off day, you know sometimes the barista is rushed or new and in training.<br /><br />You definitely need to get a real tamper to evenly tamp the grounds, the flattened spoon it comes with is a joke. Also a nice accessory would be a stainless milk frothing cup but isn't entirely necessary. To get the most extraction you gotta experiment with how fine you grind it, you want it to be close to real espresso grind but not quite, then tamp down moderately, I use the same 30 lbs tamp force as recommended and try to adjust the grind, I don't use anything fancy, just a regular cheapo automatic blade grinder and just grind til I don't hear coffee chunks in the grinder about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Doing this you'll only ever be able to fill the filter cup to the ""2"" cup marking, 4 won't flow, but this technique extracts the highest quality strongest espresso without burning it.<br /><br />Now for the extraction process to work properly you should definitely fully heat the machine, especially if you're going to use an ""espresso"" grind like I previously mentioned. This is where I did a little experimentation. Just setting it to brew will heat the water but not build enough pressure and soak the coffee too long before pressurizing to get water through the finely ground and tamped puck so you get weak yet burned espresso.<br /><br />So instead if you slowly turn the knob to steam but not all the way you'll notice the machine turns on but the steam valve won't let steam out. This is great because you can let it build up a head of steam to really push the water through the puck. So I let it heat til it actually shuts itself off, listen carefully, you'll hear a little tick and then notice the boiling in the machine stopping. This means it's fully pressurized. Then what you do is then slowly turn it to brew til you just hear it drip through, let it slowly soak into the grounds til the first drip comes out then go full blast to the brew setting. This should get you to the proper quick brewing that espresso should have so you don't extract much bitterness and you don't burn it.<br /><br />The milk steamer is a little weak but I actually fixed this with a little modding. Now people think it needs more steam, that's wrong. It needed more AIR. The real trick to foaming milk without overheating it is to incorporate air. Try it, remove the black plastic tube and try steaming the milk. It'll get hot but hardly foam at all. So how to incorporate more air? Simple look carefully at it, there's a couple holes near the top and a couple near the bottom I took a small drill bit the same size as the holes and drilled two more where they are so instead of two directly across from each other there are four 90 degrees apart. This incorporates far more air and I can froth milk completely even before it gets completely warm and the extra holes at the top also prevent the large foam bubbles from overflowing as it'll suck them back in for more foaming. Perfect, the milk is frothy warm and actually sorta smells of butter. If I want to whip up even more foam I can afterwards use my Aerolatte frother but I don't really need to after drilling those holes.<br /><br />Following these techniques made the coffee and cappuccinos from acceptable to actually quite good. I usually make mochas with Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf Cocoa powder, absolutely amazing, and everyone I make them for actually said what I make is better than the coffee shop stuff.",5,2011-10-13,6.0,,,"Great machine, a few quirks, could use a few tweaks","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
480,1,"Why spend hundreds of dollars on one of the really fancy machines, when you can spend $80 on this one and get perfect espressos and lattes every time?  I really love this espresso maker and have recommended it to all my friends.<br /><br />I've read some of the reviews on this site that state these machines can leak.  I had that problem once and lifted up the rear reservoir of water, then seated it again.  I think the valve could be where it's leaking - it hasn't been an issue since then.<br /><br />The frother is fantastic.  The only thing I don't like about it is the difficulty in cleaning the rubber tube.  My solution is to rinse the tube after every use, then drop it into a glass of soapy water next to the sink.<br /><br />I removed the bottom tray completely so I can put a larger-sized coffee cup under it - that way I have a bigger cup for more hot soy milk in my coffee, which I prefer.  After making each espresso, the machine will shoot out a small stream of hot water on the bottom for cleaning, which is normally caught by the tray.  Because the tray's no longer there, I lay down a kitchen towel to catch the hot water, then I use the wet corner of the towel to clean the frother spout after I've removed the rubber tube.  Sounds complicated but it works quite well.<br /><br />There is a learning curve when you first buy the machine, but I've become quite good at it.  My African grey parrot is my buddy every morning and watches everything I do while my latte is put together - it's become a cute daily ritual for us.<br /><br />I highly recommend this machine for everyone, including neophytes to the espresso world.",5,2009-03-11,3.0,,,Who would have thought Mr. Coffee would come out with something this good?,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
481,1,"I see that a few of the initial reviewers did a great job of covering all the features, so I'll hit the highlights and also compare it to my previous espresso maker, a DeLonghi, another popular choice at about the same price.<br /><br />First - for those that don't want to read too far - for my family, the highlight of this product is the milk reservoir. Our favorite drink is a nice, steamed, frothy cappuccino but with the DeLonghi (and most others) it was just too much of a hassle and I'd just use microwaved milk. Those units just provided the steam and often it would shoot hot water into your milk and it was a pain to have to clean the nozzle afterwards. With this unit, the milk goes into its own compartment - the machine steams it, dumps the appropriate amount into your cup and then adds the espresso. Afterwards, there's a ""clean"" setting that quickly sends some sterilizing steam through the milk path. When you're done, pop out the milk reservoir and stick it in the fridge until next time. So - still some work, but I'm much more likely to use this than I was with the DeLonghi - plus, this machine makes excellent milk froth, whereas the other one was hit or miss.<br /><br />The DeLonghi is styled in silver plastic and stainless steel whereas the Mr. Coffee is black plastic and stainless steel (or simulated ss - not sure). I actually like the look of the Mr. Coffee better, but the DeLonghi seems a bit more heavily constructed and in line with coffee house styling. This one just ""looks"" like a fancy Mr. Coffee. If you were shown the two side-by-side with the labels removed you would have no trouble guessing which was which.<br /><br />My only real complaint is that you have to swing the froth spigot out so that it is situated above your cup. If you forget to do this - as we did on the first day - the unit will gleefully squirt hot milk all over the counter. I wish it had a sensor to prevent you from starting the dispensing while the spigot was still in the down position.<br /><br />Other than that, it works great, and tastes great. The DeLonghi is being demoted to the cabin and Mr. Coffee is taking center stage.<br /><br />Can't comment on longevity - have only used it for a few days - but I'll be sure to update this review if this slightly lightweight unit fails to deliver in the long run, but so far, great!<br /><br />4.5 stars.",4,2013-03-28,7.0,,,A big step towards affordable perfection,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

540,1,"Just made my first beverage!!  I always loved the Starbucks white mocha however looking at the cost of all my coffee as I knew there had to be a way to do this at home. After doing research I looked for my own espresso machine/steamer. All of them were over $100 and I found this one for $40. Since it was so much cheaper I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing. I just made my first drink and it tastes so yummy!  Make sure you read the directions or watch an online tutorial to use the machine otherwise you will be lost and may end of breaking the machine. Also be sur to clean everything first including just running water through the machine without any coffee (the instructions explain this too). I watched a tutorial on YouTube on how to make the drink and use the machine so that was really helpful. The only thing I would recommend based on reading the reviews as well is to buy at least a 12 ounce frothing pitcher. I bought a 10 ounce and it seems a bit small. Also some reviews say to buy a tamper however you would be fine just using the spoon that  this machine comes with. Ive never been a barista or anything so this machine is perfect for me. For my flavorings I got Ghiradelli sauces for $20 for a pack of 3 on amazon (chocolate, white chocolate, and carmel). I would suggest this come with a frothing pitcher, thats my only negative.

541,1,"I had the DeLonghi EC155 previously, but it didn't produce the kind of espresso I was expecting. The grind was correct but the pump struggled to make the espresso; it would fall in small drips.<br /><br />The Mr Coffee ECMP50 is awesome in comparison. Using the same grind, it was able to produce a nice dark espresso. I noticed that the pump has a 1200 watt output, compared to the 1000W EC155.<br /><br />However, Mr Coffee has added a very cheap frother attachment, which goes more with a $30 steam machine, than the $90 pump machine. The frother attachment does not produce the kind of milk I expect - it is too bubbly, while a good frother would also thicken the milk and give it a more dense texture. The EC155 was superlative in this aspect. Anyway, my main objective is to get a good shot, and Mr Coffee ECMP50 does it better than the DeLonghi EC155. I didn't give it 5 stars due to the frother.<br /><br />I do notice quite a few reviewers saying that it breaks down after a few months of use, and that is also a lingering concern.

Also, it has a lot of parts that need to be washed each time you use it, which makes the morning routine more of a chore.<br /><br />It does make a decent cup of coffee.  You can choose between two cups to hold the coffee in.  A small one for a single shot and a larger one for a double shot.  There are buttons to select a single or double shot of espresso, cappuccino or latte.  You can also mix it up and make it anywhere in between.<br /><br />The espresso button gives you espresso with a nice cremora.  The cappuccino dispenses milk into the glass first, then the espresso.  The milk is sort of warm, but not hot.  It also doesn't really foam.  More like bubbles.  The latte dispenses warm milk into the cup then the espresso.  After trying each type, I decided on dispensing warm milk via the latte setting, stopping that, dispensing espresso, then dispensing the faux foam via the cappuccino button.<br /><br />Why don't I like this?  Because the hot, foam is very important to both lattes and cappuccinos.  A latte is supposed to have 1/3 coffee, 1/3 hot milk, and 1/3 hot foam.  This machine does not give you that.

I did purchase another EMC–250 by Mr. Coffee and it works fine although it has a life span of about 2–3 years before it leaks but for the low cost of $40.00 at Walmart it is worth the price.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />Louis,1,2015-05-02,,True,,The milk didn't froth very hot as I like it. 2,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

606,1,"I'm always a little hesitant to review an appliance. I'd hate to steer someone in the wrong direction, particularly on a high ticket item like a refrigerator or TV. I mean, really, you never know, maybe I got the only good one, or maybe my needs aren't the same as yours.  That said, Holy $&%#, this thing is amazing, PARTICULARLY for the money. It was less than half the price of my Starbucks Barista I bought 10 years ago. I can't compare it to a 3 thousand dollar restaurant style machine, because I don't have one of those.  I CAN compare it to the Barista AND my local Starbucks.<br /><br />For $200, this is an excellent value. Even the packaging was a work of art and ingeniously set up for both reliable safe shipping, and ease of unpacking. Sounds silly, I know, but when you open it up, you'll see exactly what I mean. That's always a good start. If they take this much care with the packaging, I have to assume the build quality comparable.<br /><br />The Quick start directions are all you will need.  It's FAR easier to use than any of the fancier and far more expensive machines I was considering purchasing. As a matter of fact, it's so easy to use, I think I can safely call it idiot proof.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, so my first drink was naturally a double espresso. As close to perfect as I've ever made at home. I suggest you purchase some REALLY good quality coffee to take full advantage of just how well this thing works. We purchase whole bean dark roast Costa Rican coffee exclusively and grind it as needed.  The espresso had a beautiful rich crema and was delicious.  My first foray into a latte for my wife was met with great enthusiasm. She LOVED it and when I showed her how easy it was, she was excited that she could make it herself.  Evan as a trained chef, she never really got steaming the milk for a latte or cappuccino down to an art.<br /><br />It disassembles and cleans very easily. Fill the milk reservoir with your choice, milk, soy, almond milk, half and half, whatever you'd like. Remove the reservoir and just put the unused beverage in the refrigerator when finished.<br /><br />I can't attest to the reliability or longevity of this machine, I've only had it a week, but frankly I don't care.

642,1,"This makes very good cappuccino etc, but it is cumbersome.<br /><br />1. Setup - the first time I had to prime it about 10 times before it actually started running water through.  I almost gave up since directions indicate it probably only needs to be done once or twice. Thought it was broken<br /><br />2.  It is somewhat hard to line up the device that holds the coffee grounds with the machine.. and then it feels like you are pushing too hard when you lock it in place. It just isn't elegant.  My wife has lots of trouble and has spilled the grounds several times.<br /><br />3.  The controls are not too hard to remember as far as making the coffee.  But you have to clean it each time and I find it impossible to remember that you touch the button twice to get a double shot, but have to hold the latte button three seconds and not let go until it starts to clean.. and if you didn't move the other knob to clean, you get milk froth.  I always forget one or the other.  And forget my wife or kids remembering.<br /><br />4.  You have to clean.  So every time I make cappuccino or latte, I have to remember afterwards to come back to the coffee machine to run a clean cycle... or I have to do it before I enjoy the coffee.  If I don't do it right then, it is hanging over me... If I do do it right then, the several minute process just eats into the coffee drinking experience.  When I put it off, I end up forgetting and someone else is exposed to the old milk.  Oh, and don't forget  to throw out the grounds.. expected.. but also time consuming.  And don't forget to put the milk container in the fridge without knocking off the top!<br /><br />The one thing that makes this worth it is the froth.  It is excellent froth.  With my regular machine, I often use one of those electric stirrers to whip froth... which never says frothed... This froth lasts and is hot.<br /><br />Bottom line, for a semi automatic process, it is very cumbersome.

664,1,"I'm new to the world of coffee, but already found I prefer espresso-based drinks over those brewed in a drip-style or pod-type machine. What to do, then, if you want to take baby steps towards brewing at home? For me, this machine was a no brainer. At the time, it was only about $150 (although that price has apparently fluctuated since), making it a relatively inexpensive way to try different drinks at home.<br /><br />Simply put, I adore this machine. My wife, a more established coffee drinker, also loves what this machine is capable of. With fresh milk and high-quality/ fresh coffee grounds, it's hard to taste much difference between what we're able to brew at home and what we can order from a quality coffee shop.<br /><br />My only couple complaints I have with this machine are:<br /><br />1. There are settings to auto-brew cappuccinos and lattes based off a double shot of espresso, but they also increase the total volume of the drink considerably - to the point where only a few of our coffee mugs can handle the volume. I instead auto-brew a double shot of espresso, then manually produce the steamed/ foamed milk into a pitcher (you can do so by manually holding the cappuccino button for 3+ seconds), and then pour into the drink.<br />2. I find the warm-up time to be slightly on the long side. I've countered this by plugging the machine into a Wi-Fi connected outlet, which I can activate by Google Assistant in one side of the house, giving it a couple of minutes to come to temperature before I enter the kitchen.<br /><br />There are a few things you should seriously consider adding to your purchase list if you're considering this machine:<br /><br />1. A high-quality 49-mm tamper. Yes, the plastic scoop that comes with this machine can technically double as a tamper, but after picking up a proper weighted tamper -- even the $10 budget one on Amazon - it's SO much easier to pack the portafilter with coffee in order to get a proper brew.<br />2. One or two stainless steel frothing pitchers. Especially important if you plan on brewing a drink to fill a tall to-go style tumbler, as it will not likely fit beneath the machine.<br />3. A proper knock box for coffee grounds that you can keep on your countertop by the machine.<br /><br />While yes, a much more expensive, more professional-grade machine may be more",5,2018-04-16,6.0,True,,A great intro to the world of espresso-based drinks,"Color: Red<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
665,1,"I just purchased the Café Barista and it makes great Espresso and Cappuccino. I can't comment on the quality of the latte because I don't drink latte and so I cannot judge. I developed a taste for expresso and cappuccino on my visits to Italy and more often than not I am disappointed when ordering these drinks at major coffee chains here in the states, hence why I brew my own. For years I have used manual machines and been happy with the results, however, as I get older I am getting lazier so wanted more automation - hence purchasing the Cafa Barista.<br /><br />Before purchasing this product I did my research (I am retired, but once was a research director at a not-for-profit research institute). The only concern I had was that some reviewers said the volume of the liquid delivered could be low compared to what was listed in the users manual. Upon first using the machine I thought so too. So being the geek I am I decided to conduct some experiments. I ran 10 trials under different conditions and used accurate measuring devices to measure the liquid delivered. Bottom line if you don't want to read the details is this a great little machine but not perfect - but for the price it is an amazing feat of engineering.<br /><br />What I found is that the unit consistently delivers 1.75 ozs for a single shot expresso, and 3.5 ozs for a double shot expresso. More than the advertised 1.25 and 2.5 ozs -- so no complaint there. Next I measured cappuccino output. The output delivered will vary based on the temperature and fill level of the milk reservoir. A full reservoir at room temperature will consistently deliver a 5.5 oz single cappuccino, and a 9 oz double cappuccino. A little less than advertised. If you let the reservoir get low you will see a reduction in liquid by about 1/4 oz. If you heat the milk before putting it in the reservoir you will lose another 1/4 oz of output. Hot milk is losing volume in the steaming frothing process so this makes complete sense.<br /><br />Single Latte output ranges from 7-9 ozs depending on fill level of the reservoir and temperature of the milk. For double lattes output ranges from 11-12 ozs. This is significantly below what is advertised.<br /><br />In my opinion, for the price you pay for this device this performance is excellent. And the bottom line is the taste and for my palate the espresso and cappuccino out of this machine is better than what I can do with my manual machine, and is better than 99% percent of the product sold in cafes here in the states. There is one little family run café here in the states that I visit occasionally, run be a couple of Italian ex-pats, that the Café Barista can't best - but that is the only one.",5,2017-07-14,10.0,True,,Scientific Review of Cafe Barista's Liquid Volume Output,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
666,1,"Overall this is an OK unit. I have always liked MR. Coffee products. There were, however, a few issues:<br /><br />1. The steamer arm did not always work. I am not sure if mine was defective or not, but it would steam sometimes, and at other times it would just sit there and make thumping sounds. It sounded as if the pump was trying to start and couldn't. I would try priming the thing again, and no go. Then, after I turned it off for a bit it would start working again.<br /><br />2. The frothing arm itself is way too short. In order to get the arm into a 10 ounce frothing pitcher you have to hold it up so high that the top of the pitcher is touching the machine (see photos.)<br /><br />3. When attaching the filter basket there is a little latch that is supposed to help retain the sieve in the basket when dumping the grounds. However, the latch is on the large side, and when trying to turn the filter basket into place, (again, see photo) it hits the bottom edge of the machine, and makes turning it almost impossible. It may cause breakage at some point as well if trying to turn it causes undue force. Plus, the latch does not really help with holding the sieve in.<br /><br />4. The water reservoir is very nice, easy to access, clean and fill. It holds more than an adequate supply of water.<br /><br />5. Although a lot of the machine is made from plastic (aren't most of them these days!) one of the more important ones, the top of the drip tray, is made from stainless steel.<br /><br />6.

673,1,"For the price, this machine makes a fairly decent latte but it does have some quirks. I've been using it once per day for about 4 months and figured out a few tips that help me make this thing feasible.<br /><br />First, get rid of the plastic cover over the steam arm - the bare  metal works better.<br />I use a 2 Tbsp coffee scoop for one latte and pack the grinds down with the top of a kitchen thermometer (the flat glass cover over the dial).<br />I measure the water exactly using the carafe, filling it to the 2 C line and then refilling it to the steam line. Too much water, even a spoonful, results in watered down espresso & too little, it won't steam properly.<br />I use about 6-8 oz of cold whole milk - I've also tried almond & coconut creamer - the higher fat content in whole milk & the creamers steam better. Low fat & fat free milk just won't froth well.<br />I start the brew and watch it carefully - as soon as it brews enough espresso to reach the steam line on the carafe, I immediately switch it to steam.<br />I steam the milk to about 150 degrees, testing it with the same kitchen thermometer - this makes it hot enough for me to drink right away, but some may want to heat the milk a little more, just don't go over about 165 or the milk will taste scalded.<br />To get the best froth, I submerge the steam arm tip just enough to cover it, don't stick it deep into the milk. (I just steam my milk in the ceramic mug I'm going to drink out of, even though this is &#34;backward&#34; because instead of pouring the steamed milk into the espresso, I do the opposite. Since I add sugar and stir it, I'm not that concerned that I'm doing it backward and messing up the milk :).<br />As soon as the milk reaches 150, I switch it back to brew and let if finish.<br /><br />A few observations - if I switch to steam too early in the brew process, it screams and makes a ton of noise for the first several seconds. If I wait until the brew finishes and then switch to steam, it keeps brewing and waters down the espresso and won't initiate the steam process.<br /><br />When I've gone out of town a few times and the machine wasn't used, it took it several days to get back to &#34;normal&#34; - the first few days I used it after returning, it took several MINUTES before the steam would start, following the exact steps I always do. Then after a few days of this,  it started working normally again.<br /><br />If I pack too many grinds into the grind container, it will leak water all over the place. As I said, I carefully measure 2 Tbsp for one latte.<br /><br />It's better to make lattes one at a time, when I've tried to make 2, I didn't get good results.<br /><br />I suspect this thing won't last long, but I didn't want to invest a ton of $ into a machine and I don't really have the counter space for a larger one. Even if I have to replace it periodically, it's still way cheaper & more convenient to make my lattes at home!",4,2017-07-16,,,,A few tips that made this work for me,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
674,1,"Up front, I'll say this machine makes a great espresso.  For $39, you can't go wrong.  But be aware that the difference between a good espresso and a great espresso is in the bean grinder, not the steamer-machine. I owned the previous model (ECM-150) for five(!) years, making several cups a day, until the rubber seal failed (the seal between the filter basket holder and the machine itself). Replacement seals are not available (go figure) so I bought this more recent model.  The espresso is just as good.  But I give the machine only 3 stars because of the terrible design of the on-off knob (on the left) and the filler cap that seals the water reservoir (on top).  Both are so poorly designed, so difficult to grasp, so completely un-ergonomic, that it occurred to me that perhaps the designers made them that way intentionally.  Why?  Perhaps to slow down the process?  I haven't a clue.  I am a strong man with dexterous hands and good small-motor-skills, yet I find these knobs a challenge.  They'd be impossible for anyone with arthritis, weak hand muscles, etc. Moreover, the top filler cap is set down into a sort of well, so that when the cap is loosened, any residual steam comes straight up to scald the fingers, rather than arcing out to the sides as on the previous model; always use the frother to release excess steam, then let the machine cool down before making a second cup.

680,1,"I'm a newb when it comes to brewing espresso, frothing milk, ""latte art"", etc., but after just a little practice with this machine already I can produce better caramel and mocha lattes than any of the local Starbucks. No doubt this says more about the local Starbucks than it does about me or the machine...<br /><br />Nevertheless, the machine is easy to use and seems capable of producing pretty good foam for cappuccinos and lattes. I have had no problems with leaks, excepting a couple of incidents that were my fault (see below).<br /><br />Some tips (based on a few days' use and research on [...] and You Tube):<br /><br />- Pay attention to the size of the grind and don't over-tamp! Professional machines can push water through super-fine powdery grinds that are tamped by The Hulk, but this machine isn't quite that strong. If the machine doesn't produce a steady pour of espresso after several seconds of pumping, or doesn't fill two shots in 25-30 seconds, either your grind is too fine or it is tamped too hard. In either case, the seal between the portafilter and the machine will blow out, spitting hot water and steam - be careful! This happened twice to me before I figured out that my grind was too fine (no permanent damage to the unit). Mixing in some coarser-grind coffee fixed the problem and next time I buy espresso I know what granularity to look for. On the flip side, if you get two shots in 10 seconds, you need to tamp more and/or get a slightly finer grind.<br /><br />- The black steam wand cover is a helper for novice milk foamers (like me). It makes it easier to create decent foam by pulling air down between the black rubber tip and the metal wand and into the milk. Once you've about doubled the volume of the milk you're supposed to sink the tip until the top of the rubber piece is just under the foam surface. This pulls the foam back down the wand and infuses the milk with it. It works OK, but after doing some research [...] I've removed the helper tip and am learning to froth the milk ""like a pro"" (except that so far I suck at it). Note that it's easy to make better lattes than Starbucks while using the helper tip, so it does do a decent job. If you want to experiment with ""latte art"" (rosettas, hearts, apples, etc. in the foam), which requires very fine foam (""microfoam""), you'll probably want to set the helper tip aside and learn to froth the milk with just the metal tip. [...] has some good videos on how to do this.<br /><br />- Never leave the portafilter locked into the machine (thanks [...]). The rubber gasket will stay compressed all the time if you do, and eventually it won't create a good seal.<br /><br />- Blow out some steam after you're done to make sure milk hasn't clogged the steam wand. And remove the rubber tip to clean it and the metal wand thoroughly. The tip of the metal wand is removable for cleaning as well.<br /><br />- Empty the bottom tray frequently. After the steam cycle the machine will purge excess water into this tray. It is usually about 1/3 full after I've made one latte.<br /><br />- I have only found one downside to this unit so far: there is no way to quickly turn the steam on-off-on, which would allow you to purge water from the steam wand just prior to steaming the milk. As soon as you turn the steam off after purging, the machine goes into it's internal tank-emptying process and you can't turn the steam back on for several seconds (during which water condenses in the steam wand again). This just means that a small squirt of water is going into the milk right before the steaming starts. (If you turn the steam on to purge the water out and then just leave it on as you bring the milk pitcher up to the wand, you'll end up with huge bubbles in the milk and probably milk splattered all over the place as the steam blows it around.)<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers - if this machine lasts only a year it will pay for itself many times over!

690,1,"Okay, this is my second version of this machine. When buying this machine, be sure to realize that after a year or more of repeated use, the pump may begin to lose pressure. This is normal. I work in a coffee shop and our professional $15,000 machines need to have the pump replaced every so often, and as this machine is so cheap, it's easier to just buy an entirely new one every time. I keep telling myself this, but I've kept my old espresso maker with the bum pump at the back of my closet anyway, for a rainy day project.<br /><br />If you know how to do it, this espresso maker can make great lattes and cappuccinos. I've found that it takes about five minutes to get the temperature of the milk up to around 140 (how I like my lattes), so it does take a little bit of time, but it's definately worth it. I have very hard water in my area, so I used bottled water to make my espresso: trust me, you'll be wanting to spend a quarter on enough water to make a dozen lattes rather than drink nasty coffee! I also have a burr grinder that I use in conjunction with this espresso machine, and grinding the coffee fresh before each use gave me a marked improvement in flavor and crema quality.<br /><br />On a last note, this machine can get pretty nasty if you don't know how to properly clean a pump action espresso machine after use. If you watch closely, after steaming, when you turn off the steam wand and remove the milk pitcher: that little droplet of foamed milk that hangs on the end of the wand will suck back into the machine as the steam is stopped and is instead directed out of the outtake tray. That means that the little blub of milk there just got suctioned into the metal steam wand: and it means you'll want to grab a wet rag, wrap it around the steam wand, and blow empty steam for a few seconds as it's cleared out. After that, the normal cleaning process (taking it all down, wiping it up) will suffice inbetween the &#34;big cleanings&#34; every couple of months. If you do this, your steam wand will work way more effectively and you won't be losing pressure as quickly. It'll also prevent some leakage that I've read in other comments.<br /><br />Anyway, to wrap this up, I've had this type of espresso machine for about two years now. The one I'm currently using is brand new, and the pump is a little workhorse and I've consistently gotten nothing but great shots from this machine when in like-new condition. There's probably a 1 or 1 1/2 year lifetime on the machines I've used, given daily use (and I'm mean to my machines). I haven't had a single leak in all that time, and I consistently get perfect shots and beautiful fluffy foam.

713,1,"I'm really dissapointed because when it works, this is a GREAT machine. Very user friendly, quick clean up, and it makes very tasty brews. When it doesn't work, it's completely awful. It's hard to describe the milk, so I've attached photos.<br /><br />We've gone through two of these machines in the last 14 months. The first machine was purchased for me as a Christmas gift in December 2014. It worked well and I loved brewing my own expresso at home. Then, around the tenth month we noticed that less expresso than usual was coming out the machine. Around the 12th month, it started curdling the milk.<br /><br />Though we cleaned our machine religiously after each brew and use fresh milk, when the milk went into the cup, it looked spoiled and made the coffee completely undrinkable. Luckily the machine was under warranty, so we were able to send it back and get a second machine in February 2016. Like the first one, it worked great at first. Then, last week, it began curdling the milk again. It's been two months this time.<br /><br />I called and spoke to Mr. Coffee's customer service about an hour ago and the rep was friendly and helpful, but said she wasn't sure why our machine was doing that. I asked her for suggestions on how to fix it because I didn't want a refund or a new machine, I just want my current one to work properly.<br /><br />She then put me on hold and spoke to her supervisor who also was not sure. So, they're sending us another machine...our third one in less than two years.<br /><br />I'll take the new machine, but I'm planning to look for something similar under a different brand.

769,1,"It may not be fair to compare this to my Cuisinart espresso machine, but...I ordered this to use on my vacation away from home.  Several quirks became immediately apparent.  The machine itself is light - easily pushed around by normal use, such as inserting the ground beans holder.  The ground coffee holder is plastic except for the inner bowl which is metal.  The milk steamer nozzle is plastic. The bottom where the glass pot sits is very light plastic.  Instructions tell you to fill the water dispenser on the top with 4oz of water and not to overfill.  No way to tell how much is in there after finishing each time.  Instructions also say to empty it of water after each use...how?  Turn it upside down, or steam it out which could take a while.  One of the most irritating things for me was that you have to add water every time, not like my Cuisinart that has the clear water container on the outside that holds enough for 5 espressos!  Note that the machine came with the coffee bean holder and the little glass pot.  Would have been better if a milk-steaming cup was included. Could not find one in Orange County in So. Calif.!

I had written to Mr Coffee on their website before I had it figured the problem out without a response so I figured I would let people know whom had the same problem know whet worked for me to solve the issue and I sure hope nobody gets injured.,1,2017-01-25,,,,** BEWARE WITH MR COFFEE MODEL ECMP50 FROM PRESSURE DANGER IF FILTER IS CLOGGED **,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

774,1,"I have owned this machine for a year now.  I waited to write a review as my last two (different model) coffee machines failed; one just as the warranty expired, and one at less than a month.  This, however, is still functioning as it did initially. I really enjoy my morning coffee, and most often drink lattes.  When I've had company, they have also expressed delight in the coffees that I prepared.  Some of that company was from Italy, where they have excellent coffee. Someone visiting this weekend said it was the best Latte he had every had. I do buy fresh beans and grind them and I am sure this contributes to the equation. However, I cannot say enough about how I love the fact that this machine does all of the work to froth the milk; I never was satisfied with the wand type frother available on other machines. I'm pleased that this offers both a single shot and a double shot filter and I've used both. The parts are easy to take apart and reassemble, making it easy to clean. I like that I can quickly put the milk container in the fridge if I'm dashing out the door. There is an easy steam cleaning cycle which I generally perform every time i use it (although not those days I'm dashing out the door). Yes, it is plastic but the brushed metal front is attractive and the working inside parts do a great job. It is compact for a machine that makes espressos, cappucinnos, and lattes and smaller than some drip models out there. It is very practical for someone like me who appreciates a good cup of coffee each morning, and the ability to make a variety of coffees, but will not spend exorbitant amounts on a coffee maker. I've found my happy spot in this machine. I was surprised.

775,1,"Okay, so there are a lot of mixed reviews on this product and if you are considering buying the Mr. Coffee ECMP-50, please give it a chance.<br />First of all I am no expert on this machine. I have just made my first Latte and am very relieved my machine works and the quality is what you make it as far as I'm concerned. Now understand this is my second machine! I just bought the ECMP-50 yesterday and upon setting it up, the machine only ""flashed"" it's glaring lights at me and nothing more. I was a little disheartened but figured it was a lemon, and thankfully it was!<br />So today I exchanged my machine for a new one and yes it works just fine but lets' look a little closer. So consider first off this is a low end espresso machine. $80... great price and honestly I don't expect much out of this for this price range. I am just tired of going to Starbucks and spending $3 a pop on an espresso drink. So point #1...<br /><br />1- If you can get about 30 uses out of this machine... it just paid for itself. So if it breaks after that, who cares. Buy another one! It's not a big deal.<br /><br />The steamer is probably one of the better features of this machine in my opinion. To really have full control of it though your going to need to ditch the rubber tip and just get comfortable using the machine itself. The rubber end piece while a convenient way to help maintain cleanliness and create sub-par foam, is going to hinder the quality of your drinks... plus you lose that awesome ""screaming"" sound.<br /><br />2-To properly steam your milk! GET A THERMOMETER! Yes you need this. Next you need COLD milk. Steam up to about 140-160 degrees depending on your preference and you should be good to go. To get quality foam you need not just cold milk but lift the steam wand to the top of your milk towards the end of your steaming cycle to just steam the surface.<br /><br />I can't comment on the leaking problem because I have not had this machine long enough but It sounds like a quick return to where you purchased it or sending it to Mr. Coffee should take care of this and all other structural/wear and tear defects. (hopefully)<br /><br />So. Given my experience working at Starbucks for a few years I can tell you that after using this machine. Price does not matter. Starbucks espresso machines run from $5000+ easily and they break down a lot more than you think (also get used a lot more!) But think of this like a car. It's a machine, it's going to require maintenance and cleaning. Take care of it. Use clean filtered water to prevent build up. Run recommended cleaning solutions through your machine periodically to break down deposits. This is plastic, do not be aggressive or forceful with your machine. Treat it like a lady :)<br /><br />What I don't like?<br />-So far it's just a minor inconvenience but turning the dial for the steamer setting with a required purge at the end is a little annoying. I'd rather be able to have a little more control over my steaming and be able to purge the wand myself afterwards. BUT the swivel on the wand is great, and I'm satisfied with the length and quality of it. My milk was the right temp (with thermometer) & did not take very long to do... and the foam was better than what I usually get handed at ""the bucks"".<br />-I don't like that I cannot brew espresso & steam at the same time.<br />-I don't like that the espresso will continue to brew until you turn the dial and make it stop. If your not paying attention you'll overflow your shot glass and lose your crema :( very sad. Speaking of shot glasses? Get espresso shot glasses, they will indicate where you should stop the brewing process making sure you have the best quality espresso possible.<br /><br />I know this is a bit long and I have a hard time reading long reviews but I hope this gives a little insight. This machine is worth the money and will be just as durable and reliable as machines that run in this price range up to $1,000. It's frustrating getting a lemon but it happens. Don't be discouraged.<br />Starbucks makes a great little home brew kit with 2 shot glasses, measuring scoop, clamps, steam pot, and thermometer for about $20 as well which is a great companion for this machine.<br /><br />Oh one last thing. You can buy this at Target. So very convenient to not deal with all the mail-order delays if you have an issue.<br />Best of luck, and happy brewing!<br /><br /><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Coffee-ECMP50-Espresso-Cappuccino-Maker/dp/B001EU9UTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Coffee ECMP50 Espresso/ Cappuccino Maker</a>",4,2010-08-26,85.0,,,Ex Starbucks Barista.

777,1,"I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista's features and functionality for the price.<br /><br />The Cafe Barista is rather lightweight and has a standard sized footprint.  I'm coming from a sub $100 cheap 4-cup coffee maker/espresso combo machine and the durability and feel of this Mr. Coffee obviously blows that away.  However, I'm still impressed with how well it stacks up against the $400 and up espresso machines I see at the store.  Making an espresso, cappuccino, or latte is a straightforward process of loading your favorite espresso grounds into the included single or double shot filter, loading milk if necessary, and pushing the pre-set single or double buttons on the front of the machine.  The Mr. Coffee brews quick and can produce a consistently great froth with 1% milk (I didn't try any other types).  The milk frother's arm is adjustable and there is a cool mini-tray that you can pull out to position smaller glasses closer to the dispenser to minimize splashes.  The latter is an extremely simple, yet clever feature that I love.<br /><br />I have a couple cons, but they're minor.  For starters, filling the water reservoir in a shallow sink isn't always the easiest task.  The reservoir is tall, but slim.  For my shallow sink I would have loved to see a a slightly wider, but shorter reservoir.  Also, the dispenser tends to drip/leak a little after you're done brewing.  Everytime I think my beverage is totally done, I wait another minute and watch a couple extra drips fall, but there always seems to be a few more that fall out after I grab my mug.  Still, the overall clean-up isn't bad and these complaints and somewhat personalized and/or trivial.  Given the price of this unit compared to the competition, I believe it's still worth 5-stars.

Also the little metal piece that goes into the cup the milk dries on it and hardens, even when you use the clean after use feature. So again, you need something that can get into the small metal opening and clean inside the tube. Then the thing that really is annoying is that the first cup of cappuchino you make is the most frothy and fills the cup when you use the larger fill, but you repeat that very same procedure on the next cup and it only fills half.

I anticipate that with continued aggressive rinse/cleaning we'll get rid of them.<br /><br />That said, I would happily pay $50 more for a 'pro' motel with stainless steel through the entire water/milk path.

781,1,"Espresso is an art and there are many steps in making the perfect shot. Getting this machine is the first step. It will allow you to produce nice crema. It also allows you to froth milk, but it will take longer than a more expensive machine. The machine is well-made and the parts are easy to take off and clean. The best part of this machine is that there is enough room for you to put a large coffee mug under the filter. This means if you are making a latte you don't need extra cups to pour the shot into.<br /><br />There are a couple other things you will need to make good espresso in addition to this machine. Here is a list of what I use, but other brands can do the job as well:<br /><br />Conical Burr Grinder:<br />The average grinder will ""burn"" coffee as it grinds it and cannot make a very even grind.

This one works for me, but the one amazon recommends may give better fitment:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BU7TSA/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Stainless Frothing Pitcher:<br />I used a ceramic one early and it takes far too long. This stainless heats milk more quickly and the 20oz makes enough milk for 2 lattes:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNK3Z4/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />Those 3 things should enable the average joe to make good espresso and lattes.

It should last about a few good years, sense I prevouly owned one of these. I do not expect it to last more then 2 years, so I bought an extra warrenty with this. This should give me a good bang for my buck. If it lasts past that, I will be in shock (rather). So for 31 bucks total for espresso drinks for 4 years, that is a really damn good price. They taste good too. After that and you are still in for a replacment . you and I or us will be on same mission to find an even better machine.

801,1,"This machine is cheap, but does a decent job of making a cappuccino. What do I mean by cheap? Well, the first machine I got started falling apart the moment I tried to use it; multiple screws from under where the filter holder goes started falling out along with hot water. I was very disappointed, but sent it back to Amazon and I got a new one two days later. The new one worked like a charm.<br /><br />A couple things you will need to accompany the machine (all available from Amazon as of April 25 2013): stainless steel frothing pitcher (I got Update International's EP-12 12-ounce pitcher), an espresso tamper (I got the Amco's 47mm Coffee Tamper), and of course finely ground dark-roast espresso coffee (at first I was worried that Illy would be too fine, but it worked just fine). If you've got a burr grinder that's great, but I went cheap.<br /><br />One last minute, but still (in my opinion) negative detail is the location of the frothing arm. All the (photo-shopped) photos of the ECM160 show it near the front, but it is actually located near the rear of the machine. This isn't too bad, but it would better if it was toward the front of the machine as shown in the photos.<br /><br />This was my first espresso machine.<br /><br />Update: After less than two months of use (making about one cap daily), the frothing arm disintegrated. That's right: a metallic component fell apart during use. Fortunately I was able to return it for a full refund and replaced it with a KRUPS XP601050. I've been using this machine continuously since then and have yet to regret the purchase. The difference in the quality of the espresso is phenomenal. Even the foaming is better. The ECM160 is a toy in comparison; do not waste your time or money on it. I'm now fairly convinced that an espresso machine should cost at least $100.",2,2013-04-25,,True,,Great for the price! *Sarcasm*,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

803,1,"l'm lazy and I've never used an espresso machine. I was tired of my so-so regular coffee machine coffee and wanted an entry level machine that makes tasty cappuccinos and lattes with the least amount of work. I got this machine as a bundle with a (Mr. Coffee burr) grinder and I'm glad I did. The grinder takes the guess work out of how much coffee I need to put into the portafilter since it has settings for the number of shots one is planning to make. I read that I was supposed to use 30 pounds of force tamping the coffee into the portafilter so I tested my strength by pushing the tamper down on my bathroom scale until I hit 30 pounds. Easy peasy. Almond milk into the milk compartment and half a minute later I have a cup of almond milk cappuccino that is at least as good as what I could get at an average coffee shop. I used Costco's organic rain forest blend coffee and it was neither too weak nor too strong. To clean I just filled the milk compartment with water and pushed the cleaning button and then rinsed the compartment and portafilter. I wish it had fewer plastic parts, but at this price point and the fabulous cappuccino it makes I can't complain. Also, the space under the portafilter is a little cramped and none of my tall travel mugs fit under it, so I use a glass jug that doesn't make a mess when I re-pour the coffee into the travel mug.",5,2017-01-04,7.0,True,,Almond Milk Cappuccino!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
804,1,"Great bargain. I'm very happy! This is a powerful espresso maker.  I've always had basic Krups espresso makers with the nob that let you steam while you were brewing coffee.They are OK.  I don't own a coffee tamper because the Krups machine wasn't powerful enough to push through packed coffee.  If you get this machine get a coffee tamper and use it.<br /><br />When I make café lattes for my husband and I --  I fill the carafe with cold water just a little above the silver band. That way I have enough water for the espresso and milk steaming. I'll let the espresso brew a little so there is maybe 1/2 inch or so of espresso in the carafe then I switch it to steam and take the milk to about 137 degrees, then I switch back to the brew side and finish. We each have a regular size mug of café latte. The frother works very well but we don't like a lot of foam so I won't use it much.<br /><br />The Mr. Coffee brew basket holes are just a titch bigger than the holes in my Krups brew basket. (probably like a  micron or so, I'm not an engineer.) I wondered if grounds would come through but there is no problem. I use the first espresso grind on the commercial coffee grinder and all is  well.<br /><br />You can spend a lot of money on exotic pump machines and there is nothing wrong with that.

805,1,"I will be totally honest in telling why I bought this.  As of January 1st, 2017, here in the State of Washington the minimum wage took a significant leap.  This in turn drove up the price of served specialty coffee as every little coffee kiosk in the State had to raise prices to meet the new minimum wage requirements.  I said 'phooey' to this and totally quit purchasing prepared coffee drinks!  Instead of buying myself a coffee on the way to work every morning I now make my own with this wonderful machine.  The best part is the machine has paid for itself in less than one month.  Now that I have the hang of its operation I can knock out my favorite coffee drinks and clean up in the same time I use to spend waiting in line at the coffee kiosks.  My wife swears the coffee we are getting in our own kitchen tastes better than anything we can buy from anyplace (you know who you are).

I love how it has a self cleaning feature for the milk spout. I don't mind the tamper either, for some reason other reviewers complain about it. Works fine for me.<br /><br />Other reviewers also say that their unit leaks at the water basin. I left mine with water over night once and I had no problem. Water usually stays in the basin for about and hour at a time and still no leaks. When I brew I just put in one cup of water, brew a double shot, use the self clean function and then pour out the rest that is left in the basin after I am done drinking my cup. Worry free.<br /><br />Here is a tip from my experimenting with two types of coffee. I tried the in blu lavazza espresso coffee ($10+ on amazon) and cafe bustello ($3 at my grocery store). For me the cafe bustello was very strong and bitter even in a cappuccino.

They are not expensive and need to be replaced about once every couple of years if you use it every day - but they are way cheaper than buying cappuccino everyday, even if you buy the machine once a year! That is how I look at it.<br /><br />They produce great foam (I automatically remove the plastic cover that comes on the foaming apparatus and do not use it; I just don't need it and I feel like it foams it before it heats it - probably because I steam the milk right in my coffee cup, which is small compared to a foaming carafe). And they produce a decent espresso. It is not thick espresso, but it is adequate. I know espresso is supposed to pour at a certain thickness per second - but I am not that technical or picky.<br /><br />I have bought a model every couple of years since I was a freshman in college in 2001 - I recommend it to someone who likes cappuccino, doesn't want to pay three dollars a day for coffee, and who is not an aficionado.<br /><br />How do I know when it is time to replace my machine? Either the foamer or the espresso making part just quits working, it sputters and takes forever to produce coffee, even after I give it a vinegar rinse.

856,1,"After battling with a DeLonghi espresso maker that never worked from the beginning I decided to go with this more automated espresso and milk steaming machine.  All I can say is that it is amazing.  It takes a few times to get used to the setting that will get you exactly what you want but it will happen.  It's a matter of playing with the Foam/Froth knob.  That is the main way you can get the machine to make you steamed milk verses froth.  I tend to favor more steamed milk than froth.  The crema on the espresso is far superior to that of the manual Delonghi machine I had.<br /><br />My wife enjoys the automatic features.  Just select the size latte or cappuccino and away it goes.  One warning, the large latte, well, it's large.  A standard coffee cup will be too small for this.  The large cappuccino also barely fits in a standard mug.  Due mostly to the foam.  We've had a few messes when the milk went over the top of the cup.<br /><br />I enjoy the manual feature.  You can brew a shot or double shot of espresso and then manually add the steamed milk and foam as you like it.  I like a  little less steamed milk than the machine provides for its automatic cappuccino and latte settings.<br />If you are someone who doesn't want to mess around with a crazy espresso machine and just wants an easy way to make a decent latte or cappuccino or even just add a drop of steamed milk to an espresso shot then this is the machine for you.",5,2016-02-27,,True,,Great automatic machine.,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

873,1,"This is my third home espresso machine, and I'm totally LOVING this one!<br /><br />Each of my previous machines lasted about 10 years each, so I'm a veteran home latte brewer!  My last machine was a Mr. Coffee as well, and I was really fond of the sleek design of it, so I was initially not very thrilled about this boxy look.  I considered this model for several months, only seeing it online and thinking it looked like it would take up more space than I wanted.  I finally saw one in a store then immediately came home and ordered one from Amazon.<br /><br />It has taken some getting used to, mostly because of differences between it and my last machine, but after several weeks of daily use I now love it!  What I love most is that it is REALLY FAST!!!  I guess that's the drawback of a machine that lasts 10 years... you miss out on the latest technological improvements!  This machine heats up incredibly fast, so 4 shots of coffee is done in less than 5 minutes, and steaming the milk takes about 30 seconds for two batches!  ... I'll time it soon and update with exact times. :)<br /><br />The steaming wand is very short and far back, and I thought this might be an issue for me as just a personal preference thing, but it's not, at all.  In fact, my previous machine had a very long wand that swept forward toward the front, and I would sometimes burn myself a little bumping into it.  There is very little chance of that happening with this model.<br /><br />The boxy shape of the top part of the machine is made that way to be functional so you can put the carafe or portafilter parts there to dry or store while not in use, which I actually finally started doing, so now I appreciate the boxy design.  The handles on the portafilter and carafe are longer than I'd like, and it makes me more nervous about knocking the glass carafe on the floor and breaking it.  But I'm getting used to them after using it daily for several weeks now, and I suppose it's better for someone with very large hands.<br /><br />My only lingering complaint is that the lid of the glass carafe barely snaps in, so at the slightest tap against the Portafilters spout, it dislodges.  This can make pouring the coffee a little messy if you don't realize it and re-seat the lid first.<br /><br />All around this is an amazing home espresso machine, especially for the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone wishing to make espresso, cappuccino's or lattes at home.

Difficult to open the lid that stores the water.<br /><br />I bought this coffeemaker after my old Mr.Coffee started to get clogged after 5 years of daily usage. So far I had this coffeemaker for a month and I am very pleased. I use it daily at least two times a day to make espresso (duh) and love it. The machine only takes about 5 minutes to finish brewing and it makes plenty of steam after it is done. It serves about 5 cups of coffee. There is no cleaning afterwards. No filter that you have to replace or anything. The machine is maintenance free.<br /><br />I bought this coffeemaker directly from Amazon for $39.99 and I find the price to be very reasonable. If it turns out to be as durable as my old Mr.Coffee it is going to be a steal. I have seen machines that cost double and triple and are not much better. At least not enough to justify the price (in my opinion). The machine comes with its own measuring cup and the little spoon that is used to put the coffee on the pouring spout.<br /><br />If you have a small kitchen you are going to like the fact that the machine itself is very compact and portable. It has a width of about 10 inches and a height of 12 inches. It is also very light. Moving it around would not be a problem. On the bottom of the coffeemaker you have a place to store the cable in case you want to put away the machine or use it on the road.<br /><br />The only thing I do not like is the lid used to open the water container at the top. The lid has an oval shape that does not provide a lot of friction when you are trying to open it. It makes it harder than it needs to be to open the container.  My previous machine had a square design that made it easier to grip. The new oval shape is aesthetically pleasing but less functional.<br /><br />Overall, I like the coffeemaker and certainly recommend it.

The automatic frother is easier to use, and is much easier to keep clean especially if you have a dishwasher. Steam wands can get really gunked up and are hard to clean.

878,1,"I looked at many espresso machines before settling on this one and I am confident I made the right decision. I was a barista for many years and did not like the idea of not steaming mine own milk. However, I work in an ER and needed something that was quicker that hopefully didn't sacrifice quality. I most definitely found that. I am shocked at how well the milk comes out. The setting can be adjusted from latte to cappuccino and can also be switched midway through using it. So, for example, if you have a small amount of milk you can initially put it on latte and then as the milk gets lower you can switch to cappuccino to get a frothier head thus maximizing your milk. The espresso portion is also great and easy to operate. I have been brewing double espresso’s with the single cup which allows for me to have slightly stronger drinks with the same amount of espresso I would use for a single and there is no quality of flavor sacrificed.<br /><br />There are a few things I don’t like. First, the milk container which plugs into the side can disconnect halfway through making a drink which halts the entire process. I have found I need to hold the milk container in while I make my drink which kind of defeats the purpose of it being more convenient. This doesn’t happen every time and I admittedly haven’t tried to rig it up or change its position on the table. Second, there is an option to brew a single or double espresso but no option to solely steam milk. You can set it on latte and then turn the machine off once the milk is steamed since the espresso enters the cup last – but I would like to be able to do each on their own.<br /><br />The things I really like, as I mentioned first and foremost is the quality of the beverages. They are seriously as good as I have had on any $500 machine. It is also extremely easy to clean. I mean – like really easy. It has a self-cleaning setting but all it really needs is a rinse. It also does not take up much counter space and it looks great. I can’t comment on the scoop/tamper combo because it did not come in the box, however I contacted Mr. Coffee directly and they are sending me one free of charge even though I placed my order on amazon – which I am very pleased with.<br /><br />Overall, if you are on the fence about this machine, I don’t believe there is anything better or more convenient – especially at this price point.

881,1,"If you are expecting to get the highest quality coffee experience, then keep looking.  However, this machine is perfect if you accept it for what it is, a cheaper espresso machine that is made for easy use. It is super easy to get started and everything is easy to clean.  It creates good enough coffee for home use that is about on par with Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and the like.  However, it does not compare to the mom and pop coffee shops, but that should be expected at this price range. I really have been impressed with this machine.  It does use the weird pressurized portafilter or whatever which is a con for some.  However, this helps you with the brewing process as it doesn't matter as much if your grind or pack are off.  I have not had an issue with the handle being hard to insert and twist all the way in the machine either.<br /><br />One thing to note, the holes in the portafilter basket deal do not go all the way through by design.  Some people have been mentioning in their review they keep getting faulty parts but that is just the way they are manufactured.  It is very different coming from ones that have the holes all the way through, but rest assured it works just fine.<br /><br />Others have complained about the difficulty of removing the water tank to refill it as it degrades the seal over time.  The solution to this is simple, don't remove the water tank.  The top lifts up and over and is still attached.  It makes it very easy to just fill it up via filling up a cup and dumping it in.  It actually is super convenient as I top it off every time I go to use it.<br /><br />Also, I did purchase an extended 3 year warranty (really just two years since the manufacturer covers the 1st year) for an additional $5 since quite a few mentioned that they had issues after a year.<br /><br />Another common complaint is that the machine vibrates and moves the cups around when it brews.  This is due to the finish on the cover for the drain compartment. However, you have to stand at the machine anyways while it is brewing to shut off the flow once you have the desired amount in the cup.  You might as well hold it while it fills.  However, you can also just set the cup inside a rubber band or something tacky to keep it in place.  It is frustrating that this is an issue, but really its an easy fix.<br /><br />One last note, the machine drains into the removable drip catcher after every time you use the steam function.  It just about fills to the top with moderate use so be sure to empty it each time.  Otherwise you will end up with it overflowing onto your counter.  This is what I believe the other reviewers are complaining about.  Also make sure it is aligned correctly when you put it back as the back left goes into the machine and is the point of contact for the water to drain out.  If it is not aligned correctly it can leak as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great machine.  It is cheap, easy to use, and creates decent enough results to satisfy my craving for a latte without having to go to a coffee shop.  It also saves money in the long run.  The pros by far outweigh the cons in my opinion and I'm sure you will love it too as long as you go into it with realistic expectations.<br /><br />I have added photos of the drip catcher with the cover on and off, where the drip catcher aligns in the machine, the water reservoir open, and the filters tops and bottoms.",5,2016-01-28,9.0,True,,Great Espresso Maker For The Price!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

The Moka actually makes a very good cup of Italian style coffee that we got many places in Italy. (but, to you purists, not it's not espresso.) The coffee from the Moka is stronger and thicker than espresso, but it does not have the crema of the espresso.  At least, not the way I make it.  The other beauty of the Moka is no moving parts.  We've decided, to take some of the daily load off the Mr. Coffee (to hopefully make it last longer) we will alternate between Italian coffee and espresso.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/24/13 - Stopped working yesterday.  Turn it on and the only thing that happens is the red and green lights blink at you.  Will update again after warranty repair.<br /><br />Within the last week the machine has become extremely slow to fill the espresso cup.  I don't get any crema on top of the espresso.  I've run a quart of vinegar through it in case there was mineral buildup.  We have a water softener so mineral buildup should not be a problem anyway.  I also have a 3-stage reverse osmosis filter under the sink - I use that water to fill the reservoir.  I was in love with this machine for almost 3 months.  Now I'm in hate with it.  Will try to work with Sunbeam repair to get it fixed or replaced.  More news later.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After 2 overnight soaks with vinegar, and making about 20 cups of vinegar espresso it's working again.

894,1,"Nice idea, poor product. With Krups Duomo being impossible to find, and DeLonghi making such poor espresso machines lately, we felt we had no choice but to go with this Mr. Coffee machine.<br />Let me start by saying that whoever praises espresso produced by this particular model, obviously never experienced real, European espresso! We are Europeans, living in the states for the past 20 years, and espresso is a big part of our lives. With this model being pump driven, i expected superb espresso, when compared to the steam one produced by Krups and similar espresso makers, but sadly that didn't happen, and now that i used it for few times, i see why.<br />This is not an espresso maker. This is just another Keurig knock off that we had long time ago and trashed. Same principle, same crap product that comes on the other end. You press the button 1, then stare at the button 2 until it stops blinking, then turn the button 3 to pour so called espresso in a pitcher or a cup. Eh?<br />Problem 1:<br />Water sits in a tank, and while the machine is heating up, water still sits in a tank. When you turn on the knob to make the actual coffee, it is only then that water leaves the tank, which tells me that water actually just flows over a hot element, and it does this very fast. In turn, what you're left with is almost cold shot of meh coffee. We tried to remedy this by heating up the cups or a pitcher, to no avail, still not nowhere near hot enough to be called coffee.<br />Problem 2:<br />Portafilter. One shot portafilter is way too shallow to produce a good strong shot of espresso,and you just can't thump enough coffee in there, no matter how hard you try. Two shot portafilter has a same problem, way to shallow. Once you produce two cups worth of espresso, it's so weak that is absolutely undrinkable and disgusting. Maybe we could use double shot to produce one cup, and duplicate the process for the second cup, but then you have to go thru the entire &#34;heat up, turn button 1, and 2...etc&#34; procedure again. Annoying, and who has the time?<br /><br />All in all, for a good shot of espresso i will stick with steam espresso makers, as pump driven ones simply don't work. I managed to find old version of a little Mr. Coffee espresso maker on ebay, and went with that. Had it in the past and it produced very good, strong, and hot shot of espresso for a very long time. please note that newer version of this espresso maker is very poorly made.<br /><br />Disappointed with the entire experience, and now have to bother with return.",1,2018-02-09,12.0,True,,Looks pretty and that's about it,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Café Steam",

Overall, i taught my wife to use it very quickly and she didn't try to kill me for taking away her nespresso! Winning.<br /><br />There are a few issues, but there's also one very very massive design flaw!<br />Issue#1: Sour Milk! If you ever forget to clean out the milk container with the clean cycle, you will eventually get sour milk in there. You have to use the clean cycle ever time, and you have to pipe vinegar through it periodically. Also, the repeat of pulling milk in and out of the fridge, and next to steaming water/coffee, means that the milk in the container spoils after about 2 days. You have to wash it out every 3 days! Don't just keep topping off...<br /><br />Issue#2: The drip trays can get nasty very quickly if any milk makes it's way out of the cup, which is very easy to do when the machine decides to randomly make giant milk bubbles instead of froth. It gets gross quickly, so you have to clean the drip trays at least every week.<br /><br />Issue#3: The manual and reality contradict each other. The manual doesn't give specs on how much coffee/milk each setting makes, but the quick guide does. It's wrong. The machine makes 9 ounces of coffee and 3 ounces of just foam on the large latte setting, not 15 ounces like the book says. It's trying to tell you a 15 ounce cup so nothing spills over, so just expect to get 9 ounces of drinkable latte for each large doubleshot setting. You can use the extra froth button to get more, though. Not a deal breaker, but pretty annoying. No, the real issue, is that it's never consistent in the amount you get for each setting. Or the fact that the foam is actually very loose, while good foam is supposed to be tighter and denser, this machine's foam is so loose that stirring quickly kills half of it.<br /><br />Issue#4: Critical Design Flaw! The porta filter basket has a plastic insert which leads the coffee from the porta filter exit, to the basket exit. It also exits the filter and has two protruding plastic ends. This whole plastic is held in place with a small screw on the bottom of the basket, from the outside. This means any time you put pressure on the coffee in the filter (like when you push with 30# of force to tamp espresso every time you make espresso), you're putting 30 pounds of force onto the plastic the screw is holding onto and the protruding plastic bits are fighting you. I've had this machine for two months, and the screw stripped itself out, the plastic is no loose, the filter won't stay tight, which all means the machine is useless at making coffee. Customer support told me it would be 2 to 3 weeks until they have a replacement part in, for which i'll have to call them (they won't call me) to order that replacement part. I'm not holding my breath. Who knew the demise of this machine was one little screw that would strip and fall out? Oh wait, I should have paid more attention to the reviews, because it happened to others...I'm putting a wooden block narrower than the two plastic prongs to have metal facing the force of tamping down. It's wobble and i will likely injure myself at some point, but my only other option is to pony up for a Breville...",2,2018-02-26,7.0,True,,Critical Design Flaw!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

You tun on the unit when you start because it takes a minute to heat up before you can brew.  Behind the unit, the full width and height has a water container that you slide easily up and off to refill the water. It holds a lot of water, so you don’t have to refill it very often.<br /><br />So you grind your coffee beans on smooth grind then use the scoop to fill the little brewing thing and flatten the coffee then you add maybe an inch of milk to the milk container and slide it in.  I use a regular mug, hit the double cappuccino button. It steams the milk into the cup, then brews, dripping the coffee into the cup.<br /><br />The thing to remember on this is to right away put the remaining milk in the fridge or rinse the container immediately after making your coffee. It’s really easy to pull the milk container components apart, rinse them and set to dry. If you do that, your cool.

I had to use regular ground coffee to make it .. or use less coffee with double filter . The only super thing here is the milk frother , but I am not sure if I want to keep it , coffee taste is not what it should as the water keep going too long burning its taste . I will try to grind the coffee less fine and see how it works .For the regular price it is not worth purchase as there are better espresso maker for the value today , but I will give it a chance once again and if not happy with this will be my last Mr.Coffee purchase ever . 4 starts for milk frother, 2 stars for espresso since it can;t handle fine espresso coffee .",4,2016-12-12,2.0,True,,expected more :(,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
921,1,"I've owned this machine for nearly a year now and overall I really do like it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-- It's simple/easy to use. (That's a big pro to me). I'm not a barista. I have 2 young kids and needed something quick and easy.<br />-- It's compact. It doesn't take up much counter space.<br />-- The water reservoir holds quite a lot and is easy to remove/refill.<br />-- Easy to clean. Milk container and lid are dishwasher safe (though it does not specifically say if the silicone &#34;straw&#34; attachment is, so I've washed that by hand.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-- It's quite loud, but I'm not sure there is such a thing as a quiet espresso machine.<br />-- The space that holds your mug is too small. In order to make a small sized latte, you need a decent sized mug to avoid overflowing. If I wanted a large latte, the space provided is not big enough to be able to use a mug large enough that it wouldn't overflow. A large mug may fit under the brew head/porta filter just fine, but the milk dispensing tube will not fit/be able to aim into your mug properly.<br />-- The silicone &#34;straw&#34; that attaches inside the milk reservoir is incredibly easy to LOSE. It's small, clear, and can easily go down a kitchen drain. Just a heads up. I've gotten lucky with it so far. I wish it had come with 2 or 3 of them as I'm sure I'm not the only one who has had issues with that.<br />-- At some point a couple months ago, I started experiencing what others had posted about the milk not frothing properly. It has been touch and go ever since. I cleaned the entire machine, thoroughly washed the milk reservoir and it's parts, etc. and it seemed to froth properly for a while but some days it has a mind of its own and comes out watery again and I'm not sure what is making that happen. That has been the only true disappointing thing as I can't figure out how to fix it. The milk just spits out watery and then the latte isn't thick and creamy like it should be. I've cleaned the milk reservoir by using the &#34;clean&#34; feature on the machine, I've taken it out and washed it thoroughly, I've scrubbed around all pieces on the machine that may affect it, etc. and some days it froths and some days it doesn't. I have thoroughly enjoyed this machine up until this point... it doesn't get much more simple than this with an espresso machine, but I wish there were clear instructions on what to do if this happens as it seems to be a common issue.",4,2018-02-10,,True,,"User friendly, but having some issues after 9+ months use.","Color: White<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

1059,1,"I want to start off and say the main reason I purchased this unit was for the steam wand.  I needed a Diamond Steamer and I didn't want to pay $100 for a Jewel Jet or similar jewelery steamer.  I did some research online and on diamond forums and found that the espresso machine steamers produced steam that was capable of cleaning jewelry.  For the $37.00 price tag of this machine I decided it was worth a shot.  I filled up the machine and did a test run to see how good the steam was and all I have to say is it is more than sufficient to clean jewelry and I give it a huge thumbs up in terms of value versus the stand alone steamer.<br /><br />Now onto the espresso making part of this machine.  It is very simple in terms of its operation.  I used to be a former barista and it makes decent enough espresso to be used for lattes, cappuccinos, and americanos because the milk and flavoring mask most bad pulls.  Now the flavor of the espresso really is a function of the grounds you choose and the grinder that you have available to you.  You will have to experiment with the grind coarseness to match this machine exactly.  I just received my unit but I will be experimenting to see what the ECM160 likes in terms of how fine or coarse my grounds need to be.  I have read other comments about the ECM160 and blowing up and other places online have addressed this issue and it seems that some users are either tamping much too hard, using too fine of a ground, or not locking in portafilter far enough.  Also users need to look under the unit for the rest of the cord. It is just coiled underneath for shipping purposes.<br /><br />I do wish the wand was longer and could be moved, but I still find it is useful.  The plastic steaming attachment really needs to be removed as it is of no help at all.  I was actually impressed with this little units ability to froth milk.  I created very very thick foam with this unit on the first try using a coffee mug and 2% milk.  If you want the really dry foam the trick is to work the tip just underneath the surface of the milk.<br /><br />The carafe that comes with this unit is fine and if it does break like others have mentioned you always have the option of getting actual espressso shot glasses and using those as a true measurement for each shot.<br /><br />Now I do wish they would have provided a better tamp and milk carafe but at this price they would probably be junk anyways.  My biggest concern is with the portafilter.  I have to double check the dimensions but I don't think it is a standard size.  It seems a little flimsy and I would like to replace it with a double spout unit if possible.  I still have more research to do on this part.<br /><br />My last recommendation is for everyone knocking the quality of this unit, spend some money on a very good burr grinder such as the Baratza Maestro Grinder.  A good burr grinder along with good beans will do a world of difference for your espresso.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this unit to people as a cheap espresso solution.  It's cheap enough for people to try.  It's also a good backup and travel unit.  The added bonus is the jewelry cleaner.",5,2010-04-17,53.0,True,,Dual Purpose and Bang For Your Buck,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

The frother is adequate, though I've had no luck frothing soy milk or almond milk. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I've tried a few brands of lactose free milk. I've found that Lactaid brand milk with 1% milk fat works best in my machine. Fat free, 2% and whole lactose-free don't froth as well as the 1%. Also, the brand of milk seems to effect the frothability. The upshot is that you may have to experiment a bit with both the milk and frother adjustments, but with a little effort you can find a combination that yields a very satisfying brew. It's good enough that I've discontinued my morning cafe stop on the way to work, so this machine will more than pay for itself in a few months.",4,2018-06-23,,True,,Pleasantly Surprised,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

1075,1,Great price during the post-Thanksgiving period and makes great coffee with ease. The milk dispenser can vary quite a bit depending on 'cleaning' and can foam over even a large cup with set to double latte or cappacino. The foot print was actually smaller than my regular electric coffee pot. Fast excellent individualized serving.<br />Was somewhat disappointed by the second week of use as the silicone tube that incorporates the milk can be easily lost during the frequent cleanings that it is needed (&#34;after every use&#34;)....but eventually found replacements directly from the Mr. Coffee website for a fair price. Still very happy with quality of coffee and the fact that milk frothing is automatic with no need to pre-heat...just be sure spout is in the cup and better to use higher walled cups to avoid splatter...unfortunately you will find double latte cups do NOT fit under the spouts so order smaller latte cups.,4,2015-12-08,2.0,True,,Very good coffee conveniently and priced right.,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
1076,1,"This small compact machine makes great espresso & cappuccino for $30.00.  It reminds me of the Krups machine I had years ago.  It's similarities made it easy to use.  I was enjoying my 1st cappuccino within minutes.  The only negative was the plastic sleeve to froth the cream which can be easily removed to make it work properly.  My first attempt was with the plastic sleeve on and the cream splattered every where.  I removed the plastic sleeve on my 2nd cup and I had no issues frothing the cream, no splatter at all.  For those of you needing help making great cappuccino here are my recommendations.  You do not need to use espresso grounds.  I actually find that the espresso grinds are too fine and when lightly tamped down using a small spice container the steam has a hard time making it's way through the grinds and steam escapes through very small gaps thus reducing the steam for frothing.  I use Militta classic blend coffee lightly tamped down with a small spice container.  As far as frothing the cream or milk I highly recommend adding an extra ounce and a half of water so there is enough water to steam your cream or milk.  I have lived in Italy for 3 years when I was young and the cappuccino I make using this machine and Militta coffee taste just like I remember.",5,2016-02-13,,True,,Fantastic for the Price,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

1078,1,"This is a great machine! When I worked, we had a $6000.00 machine and I can't say it was better!  The only thing it did was grind/fill/dump old coffee grounds.  I can't say that is worth $5925.00!  Seriously, this machine make a perfect Espresso and Cappuccino.  We use the dark whole beans at Sam's club and grind a small counter-top storage container at a time with our magic bullet.  Highly recommend this over a coffee bean grinder.  It isn't as messy, easy to use, washable and you can see when the beans are ready.  You have to play around with the fineness of the grounds, ours are almost power like.  We also removed the rubber piece from the steam wand.  Again, you have to learn how to froth your milk.  It only takes about 1 to 1.5"" at the bottom of your stainless frothing cup.  You have to swirl, lift and dip - I find the best froth comes when you put the tip just before removing it from the milk.  It takes a little while to get to this point, just keep moving it.  Otherwise, you will burn the milk. Patients and practice!  When we first started, it seemed like it took forever to make just 1 cup.  Now, it is quick and easy.  I make my cup while heating my daughters pancakes in the toaster. It is that quick and easy!<br /><br />The only downfall is the height where you place your cup.  We like using the double cup and making a large coffee mug.  You have to tilt the cup to get it underneath - same to remove it. Since you have to leave space for your froth, it doesn't spill... it would just be easier if we didn't have to do this.  @ Mr. Coffee: raising it just a 1/2"" would solve this problem!",4,2012-08-10,9.0,True,,We are addicted!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

I've been washing it through with water cycles and even trying to leave the pressure cap off to let it air out, but the taste/smell has only gone away slightly and I've had it for almost a week and a half.

1112,1,"I've never reviewed anything online, but felt compelled to review this product. I purchased it as an 'interim' fix until I could afford to get my isomac tea fixed (which turns out was not even worth fixing) based on reviews read on Amazon. We've had it about 3 months. I have been pleasantly surprised by the both the acceptability of flavor of shots and by the ability to foam. While I would not use this machine if the majority of your coffee are espressos, if you do mostly milk based or frozen drinks as I do, I've found it works fine. Nobody but me can tell the difference between drinks made from this machine or the isomac (or Rancilio previous to that). Are the shots as good as from those machines? No; when you had good shots from those machines, they were fantastic; but unfortunately over 6 years of using those machines I found there are so many variables that I often ended up with not very good tasting shots. Shots from Mr. Coffee are not quite as good, but more consistent, so I'll take it.  This machine does not foam as nice either, but the foam is better than I had anticipated once I practiced -I would call it a light 'almost' micro foam. I would take a latte made form this machine over Starbucks anyday. And now the good news. The Rancilio I had was $600, the Isomace Tea over $1400, and they were repaired before they went bad. Total cost of ownership over 6 years - about $3,000. I was using pre-softened RO water, but found out after that the people who sold me the machines didn't give me full information on RO units not filtering out calcium or lime, so certainly the damage to the machines was partly my fault; none-the-less, even if I had added in all the additional water softening equipment, upkeep, etc. over those years, it would have easily added another $1000. Would I love to have an upscale fancy machine again? Yes, I loved having them, but I just can't justify the cost anymore-not when I can replace the Mr. Coffee for less than it cost me just to ship my previous espresso machines to get fixed! They take up less counter space, can be taken to a friend's house for parties, and with our hard water in Las Vegas will no doubt scale up in probably less than a year, or the pump will blow out; then I'll spend another $70 at Dealyard and be good for another year-which I am more than happy to live with.",5,2009-11-21,2.0,True,,Not toooo bad,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

1132,1,"UPDATE TO REVIEW: I decided to keep the second Cafe Barista despite the initial leaks. I have found that if I am extremely careful in placing the reservoir onto the base unit without pressing down on the spring-loaded valve before is fully seated it will not leak. So far at least it has not leaked since the initial use. Overall it is a very useful espresso maker. Simple, elegant, and makes a good product. Overall I like it but had to mark it three stars because I do think the design of the water reservoir is problemmatic. My initial experiences with leaking in addition to other reviews here indicates this is a common problem.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW I have very mixed feelings about the Mr. Coffee Café Barista. I wanted very much to be completely satisfied with it because I do believe it is a great entry-level espresso machine with unique features.  Unfortunately, I had to return the initial one I purchased which I exchanged for the exact same model.  My experience with the second one was not much better.  In both cases, the unit leaked significantly from the base of the water reservoir. I thought for certain the first one was an aberration (although other reviews on this site indicate it is a common problem) and felt confident the replacement would work without problem.  The replacement also leaked although not quite as substantially.<br /><br />I really liked the espresso and lattes the Café Barista produced. In shopping for a comparable model I am shocked at how few incorporate the milk steamer into the unit and offer the ease of use in preparing espressos, lattes, and cappuccinos.  The drinks we were able to make -- while desperately mopping up water flowing out the back of the unit -- were quite good.  Not perfect but good enough for what I am looking for.  The leaking water, though, is untenable and I am inclined to return this second model.  I know I could possibly fix the leak with some silicone around the water inlet nozzle or other alterations.  But I am not inclined to do this for a machine at this price -- for $200 it should work out of the box.  It is really quite disappointing that the water reservoir is designed so poorly that the leaking happens so easily.  It is clear that the rubber gasket does not seal sufficiently and water leaks around the nozzle and then trickles out of the surprisingly insufficient drip tray.  The problem could easily have been fixed in design by simply eliminating the removable feature of the water reservoir and leaving it permanently attached to the base.  Or, by simply designing a better sealing gasket and/or providing rubber flanging around the base of the water reservoir.<br /><br />Overall, these are the pros and cons of the Mr. Coffee Café Barista:<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Great tasting lattes, cappuccinos, and espressos<br />- The attached milk steamer is a neat and rare feature on these home espresso machines<br />- Nice look and does not take up too much counter space<br />- Good price for its potential<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The significant water leaking is an overriding problem<br />- Does not make drinks very hot -- I am fine with this as I prefer drinks lukewarm but others may want hotter drinks and I was unable to figure out how to get it to make hotter drinks<br />- Inconsistent size of the beverage. This would not be a big problem for me but others may want more consistency. The drinks seem to vary by 1-2 oz. in size with each attempt. My understanding is that this may have something to do with the setting of the frother and also how closely packed the espresso grounds are. If I had more time and were not running out of towels in my kitchen I might have experimented further.",3,2013-11-07,8.0,,,Simple and Elegant Espresso Maker But Tends to Leak,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

I really probably should properly clean/descale it for sanitary reasons, but I'm just saying it works well for years with very little maintenance!<br /><br />As for using for entertaining, yes, it may be a small machine, but I've been able to pull five or six double shots within a very short amount of time and no trouble with the water not being hot enough. Now, that was for iced coffees, meaning I didn't use up heat for the steam wand, so that might be a different story if you wanted hot drinks. But it seems to heat back up rather quickly after each use.<br /><br />Another feature I really like is the large water reservoir -- I feel like it takes weeks before the water line goes below the ""min"" level. And the handy scoop/tamper works perfectly. I use the double basket for myself because I like a good 2-3 ounces of espresso in my iced white mochas. For my husband, who likes his drinks a little sweeter and with less of a ""coffee flavor,"" I'll use the single basket. I either buy espresso beans from a local coffee house and have them grind them or purchase them in the grocery store and grind them there (on espresso grind, of course). I may one day invest in a grinder of my own, but for now this is what works for me, and I know the beans are ground to the right size and will work every time.<br /><br />I can't speak much to the steam wand for steaming milk because I primarily drink iced coffees, so I mainly only use it for the initial warm up when turning on the machine. I did try steaming milk a couple times and found that it took a long time for the milk to get hot enough, and by then most of it was foam, HOWEVER, this was after owning and using the machine for over two years, so it's possible that it was just old and therefore not as powerful. Other reviews say the milk heats up quickly, so I'll take their word for it.<br /><br />Only recently, after owning and regularly using my Mr Coffee for over three years, have I noticed a little bit of leaking that happens when I initial turn the machine on, while waiting for the OK light to come on. That never happened before, and it still works great, and I'm sure it's just regular wear. Honestly, these small machines probably aren't intended to be used every single day and work perfectly for this long, so I'm overjoyed that it is still working, and I'll happily put up with a small dripping when it's the only sign of wear that I've encountered.<br /><br />For my birthday this month, my husband said I could pick out a new espresso machine, and being one who likes to try out something new and different, I have settled on the DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker. I've only had it for a couple days, and I'm still getting the hang of the slightly different style and warmup, but so far it seems to be just as good as (if not better than) the Mr Coffee. We'll see. I plan to hold off on that review for a few months.<br /><br />Not that this is the end of dear old Mr Coffee, no siree!

1197,1,"I love my coffee, especially through the cold, dark, winter days. I've been buying from our work cafe for years now, since they serve white coffee, but I resolved this year to save money and brew my own. After reviewing a few of the lower priced units on here (lets admit, I'm only using this for personal use, so I'm not too picky), I decided on the Mr Coffee ECM160 model, and was pleasantly rewarded.<br /><br />The machine itself appears relatively sturdy and compact, and fits quite nicely on my counter. As other reviewers mentioned, it is necessary in some cases to unwind the cord at the base for additional length. I did not have to, where I have it located. The stainless steel finish is nice, and I like the ridged top - it makes it easy to clean. The carafe and lid are dishwasher safe, as is the basket, although I prefer to hand-wash. But, for convenience sake, this could be noted.<br /><br />I find that the scoop included works well for standard espresso, but when making white coffee (my preferred method), it's best to err on the side of under-filling, as the white coffee seems to expand more when the steam is pressed through. For four shots, it takes roughly 5 minutes to brew, and I plan on taking the recommendations of others and cleaning/descaling with vinegar on a regular basis to prevent any slowness. I do the same for my Keurig, it's just part of basic maintenance.<br /><br />The steaming attachment is kinda cheesy with the plastic case, so I just take that off (I find it's easier for me to clean without it). I use it to heat/foam my milk, and as I mentioned in the title, it foams like a beast! I use rice milk, and have had NO problems whatsoever in building an absurd amount of foam. It takes a few minutes and some angling, but it's not a pain by any means, and as a foam lover, totally worth it.<br /><br />For $40, I love this machine. The plastic bits aren't as fancy as a professional espresso, but I'm in this for utility, not looks. We make 2-3 espressos daily, and on Sundays I pre-brew a quart jar of white coffee so I can add it to my breakfast protein shake with ease.

1200,1,"Awesome espresso machine. It does the job for the price.. Coffee comes out really good but You have to make sure that you use filtered water and  fresh ground coffee. Also, don't forget to clean the steamer every time you use it, and make sure that some steam comes out at the end, if not the steamer will get clogged. The part that I didn't like was that you are able to make only 2 cups of espresso at a time (if you are looking for a late or capuccino) main reason is because you need half the water to brew the coffee and half the water to steam the milk. If you are not a pro like me and you are looking for a good espresso machine, this is the one. I''ve had this coffee maker for about a year and it is great.

We have owned this unit for a month and have made many cortaditos and cappuccinos.  There is a learning curve and I am still fine-tuning my grinds, sugar types and milk steaming technique.  My coffees are getting better and I am enjoying the process and the caffeine buzz.<br /><br />I have had no problems with the machine at all.  The instructions were not clear enough on a few things, like the role of the lever on the handle of the ground cup holder.  Watching a couple of YouTube reviews of the machine cleared things up.<br /><br />Tips:<br />*Put some water in your espresso cups and microwave them for 20 seconds to get them warm<br />*Use the double shot cup.  The single cup just doesn't make it.<br />*Put raw sugar in the espresso cup before pulling the coffee.  Stir the sugar in before adding the milk.<br />*A steel 12 oz frother is a inexpensive addition and makes for better frothing.<br />*I decided to leave the rubber frother cover on: easier cleaning.  Make sure it goes on all the way and does not block the steam exit hole when re-installing.<br />*To cut the prep (bean grinding) time, we are using Cafe Bustelo decaf and regular espresso ground coffee.  It's ground finer than the instructions recommend, but works great.  We can find it everywhere, including on Amazon.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />If we get a year out of this machine I will be happy.

The most difficult part,is getting the right ratios to make your latte (or cappuccino). The espresso part is pretty easy.<br /><br />One of the reasons we decided to go with this machine is the fact that you can put a larger mug/cup under it.

It gives you about another inch or so clearance. The lights/labeling are all very clear and easy to understand too.<br /><br />You should really buy this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XRNEM/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />and this: http://www.amazon.com/Update-International-EP-12-Stainless-Frothing/dp/B000MR6I9I/ref=pd_sim_k_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0V42FG7K080GGQ2129PV<br /><br />The tamper and the stainless steel frothing pitcher. None of those things come with the machine. You NEED a tamper. The pitcher, well, you could get away with using any vessel with handle. You also need a good grind of coffee made especially for espresso. We bought this brand and are very happy with it: http://www.amazon.com/Lavazza-Espresso-Ground-Coffee-8-Ounce/dp/B004N71J7O/ref=pd_sim_k_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=0V42FG7K080GGQ2129PV. We have a coffee grinder, but I've read that you really need a GOOD one in order to get the beans ground fine enough.<br /><br />My only real complaint, and it's just my pet peeve, is that the espresso/milk doesn't really get hot enough. When I get lattes from coffee houses, I generally ask them to make it &#34;super hot&#34;. They can, because their machines can control the temperature. Again, this is not a super expensive machine that will do that. Sometimes, we heat water up in the cup we are going to use, in the microwave to get it hot in order to hold the heat of the coffee better. It does the job:)<br /><br />So far, we are really enjoying this machine and highly recommend it!",5,2014-03-03,2.0,True,,Awesome little esspresso/cappuccino/latte maker!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

1259,1,"So after opening this, I expected to have to clean it, but I didn't expect it to have as much trash and manufacturing byproduct in it as I did.<br /><br />The first time I steamed milk, it tasted like licking a circuit board (semi-expected) so I figured after running a bunch of steam through it it would go away. However, much to my dismay, I looked in the cup I used to catch the steam and water that was shooting out and there were metal and plastic particles in the water! I was absolutely shocked. So I ran more steam through it (filling it up to it's max with water and letting it all go through the steamer) probably at least 6 times,  and each time metal and plastic came out. When I finally stopped getting particles out of the steamer, I tried to steam milk again, and it still tasted like circuit board. I thought it would've been well clean by now, but it wasn't. Then I switched over to the espresso side to see what would happen, and when the water came out I found a white flaky substance in the water. Again, horrified, I decided to clean it, only this time I stepped up my game and used part for part vinegar and water. I let it go through the steamer about 3 times, and the espresso part 3 times (both times using the entire tank for each cleaning). Then, and ONLY then, did I stop seeing mysterious particles in the water and the coffee/milk started tasting like it should. I was shocked it wasn't more clean than it was. Seriously, I probably could  have sued them had I documented all of the contaminants I found in the water after cleaning it so much.<br /><br />That aside, as an espresso machine for a novice barista, it works well. Easy to use, easy to clean, steams milk well, brews espresso well. No bells and whistles, but it fits my needs and makes a good latte once you get the hang of it.

The best thing is the dial on the side that allows you to control the steam by shifting from &#34;brew&#34; to &#34;off&#34; to &#34;steam&#34; (for frothing). You will need to separately purchase some must haves... a stainless steel tamper, frothing pitcher and rubber mat for accessories. But they're well worth it.<br /><br />Tip:  THE SECRET TO GREAT FROTH!!!<br /><br />I have used the ECM-160 for over a year and it's perfect for making amazing froth for cappuccinos (big, super-smooth froth that rises 3/4 inch+ above the rim of your cup like whipped cream) but you have to know the secret.  And here it is:<br />First...  use the right milk... 1% works best. More fat, and it tends to &#34;spit&#34; everywhere while frothing.<br /><br />Second...  the milk has to be ICE cold, and kept cold while frothing. &#34;How am I supposed to do that??&#34; you may ask.  My trick is to get an ice cube tray for tiny-sized cubes (I found one at the supermarket that makes small, grape-size ice cubes that work perfectly) and make frozen milk-cubes.<br /><br />Third... put about four to five frozen milk cubes in your stainless steel frothing pitcher, then add more cold milk until its about 1/3 full.<br /><br />Fourth...  take one of those small, palm-sized &#34;blue-ice&#34; freezer paks out of your freezer and palm it against the bottom of the pitcher as you froth the milk. This further helps to keep the milk from overheating and breaking down.  Make sure to keep the tip of the frothing tube nozzle just below the surface for best frothing effect.<br /><br />Fifth, froth until the stainless steel pitcher is about as hot as the hood of a car that's been driving around for a while.<br /><br />Using this technique, I've been able to get the entire frothing pitcher to overflow with fine, beautifully smooth froth on a consistent basis.  But it still takes some finesse in the technique.  It's a bit of an art.<br /><br />To really kick-it up, add some flavored International Coffee creamer to the milk before frothing.  You have to try out different flavors because each one changes the frothiness to a greater or lesser degree.<br /><br />Enjoy!",5,2014-09-12,,,,FantasticEspresso/ Cappuccino maker - The SECRET to Great Froth too!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

1281,1,"My husband and I are not coffee drinkers per se. Neither of us can tell the difference between gourmet and cheap coffee, nor between espresso and regular coffee except for the espresso having a higher caffeine content.  For us, coffee is a flavoring for other things:  In the present instance, frothy milk drinks.  We are, however, quite particular about the milk.  It must be very thick, frothy, and hot. It may be flavored with coffee only, or with coffee and chocolate, or with coffee, chocolate, and an addition such as rum, Grand Marnier, almond extract, walnut extract, cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. Not to mention artificial sweetener. The drink also must be low fat, low calorie, and low priced, all things coffee shops notably fail to deliver.<br /><br />Thus we are devotees of DIY caffe mochas, lattes, etc. And when we received this machine, we rushed to experiment with the milk frother. The Mr. Coffee machine has a separate milk tank (which can hold milk in the refrigerator before use, be sterilized with hot water immediately after use, and be removed for washing later). The steamed milk comes out deliciously textured and piping hot.  This is far preferable to another espresso machine we have, which requires heating the milk in a pot on the stove, pouring it into a mug of a size that fits under the nozzle, and holding the mug there till the milk froths slightly, hopefully without cooling off too much.<br /><br />Overall, the Mr. Coffee machine is easy to use and easy to clean.

What you get with a &#34;steam toy&#34; is much more like what you get with a mocha pot.<br /><br />If you are going to make lattes, it may not matter as much, as the milk hides or neutralizes the yuccky acidity.  But for real flavorful espresso, get a modest pump machine.<br /><br />If you already have a steam unit, you can get a slight improvement by shutting it off about halfway into the shot (you have to experiement).

1295,1,"Update 5/29/16:<br />It still works good after several years. Perhaps this is because I only use distilled water (no scale buildup).<br /><br />Original review:<br />I agree with all the other positive reviews here and don't have much to add. However, the Mr. Coffee Barista manual is vague as to the volumes of cappuccino and latte to be expected. It does not give the actual amount of coffee, but rather the size cup to use (single espresso = 1.25oz, double espresso = 2.5oz, single latte = 12oz, double latte = 15oz).  I have found that the volume will be much greater if the milk level in the reservoir is at max. BE CAREFUL, a double latte or double cappuccino with foam can EASILY OVERFLOW THE 15 OZ CUP!<br /><br />Actual Amounts (not cup size):<br />I measured actual amounts of coffee and milk with a digital scale (amounts do vary somewhat each time).  NOTE: the level of milk in the reservoir will change the amounts.  These are by weight, and the total includes condensed steam but (of course) doesn't include foam volume.  I used distilled water, cold full fat milk and espresso ground coffee (I prefer Lavazza Crema e Gusto). The porta-filter and filters were washed and dried between measurements, and the milk reservoir settings were set to &#34;Latte&#34; or &#34;Cappuccino&#34; as recommended by Mr Coffee.<br /><br />Single espresso (7g coffee) = 28.5g (1.0oz)<br />Double espresso (only 7g coffee) = 57.0g (2.0oz)<br />Double espresso (14g coffee) = 54g (1.9oz)<br />Custom espresso for cafe Americano (hold espresso button) = up to about 5 oz<br /><br />Single cappuccino (milk reservoir full) =  130g (4.6oz) containing 79g (2.8oz) milk<br />Single cappuccino (milk at half full) = 117g (4.1oz) containing 68g (2.4oz) milk<br />Double cappuccino (milk at half full) = 187g (6.6oz) containing 113g (4.0oz) milk<br /><br />Single latte (milk reservoir full) = 197g (6.9oz) containing 143g (5.0oz) milk<br />Single latte (milk at half full) = 173g (6.1oz) containing 128g (4.5oz) milk<br />Double latte (milk reservoir full) = 281g (10.0oz) containing 194g (6.8oz) milk<br />Double latte (milk at half full) = 252g (8.9oz) containing 167g (5.9oz) milk",5,2014-10-15,11.0,,,Actual Measured Coffee Volumes,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
1296,1,"I've had this unit for  greater than 6 years using it daily for morning double shot 'cap'.  Read instructions and several websites and many reviews to avoid brewing or maintenance errors.  Using vinegar every 2-3 months for descaling.  Twice have disassembled and cleaned/inspected the removable parts.  Cant say that ive used a needle to clear holes in the portafilter or main filter.<br /><br />Filling with the finest grind created daily with economical burr grinder and never tamping only leveling with palm of my hand has served me to extract full flavored espresso with adequate crema.  (Imported/expensive whole bean torrefacto from Spain gets the  credit for the best flavor since residence in Madrid).<br /><br />  Recurrent leakage initially was due to removal of water reservoir for filling filtered water at frig .  Once I resorted to filling by large cup in place this small leak minimized.  Now years into use the counter top will flood if the descaling is not done more frequently.  I must always empty the tray after every use.  The volume of coffee is smaller and the flow rate is less regardless of the descaling.  Six yrs is very good service and replacing this unit with an identical one is my plan.  Better maintenance frequency perhaps with a formal descaling product may be an upgrade.  More education via utube for cleaning is another target.<br /><br />This is very good, albeit not excellent espresso, producing unit at VERY reasonable price.  Available at Target or Walmart?  Yes a bit noisy and coffee is not as hot as preferred nor is the steam created as hot as needed for the best foam.  Still this machine has not been a major problem and relatively easy to maintain.  Preheating the mug would help significantly if I took the time and effort to do so.<br /><br />Prior years have used with fair to good satisfaction, the stove top 2 piece unit originally from Spain or Italy made of aluminum, now stainless  which lack a foaming option but allowed for hot milk to be incorporated.  Simple and reliable served me well for over 20 years. (imported coffee made it worthwhile)<br /><br />Several times I have researched machines at double or triple the price.  None appear to have the low price to upkeep ratio this one offers.  &#34;Lemons&#34;  may be received regardless of product chosen.  At a higher or much higher price with considerably more options and maintenance steps I hesitate to take the plunge.  If I knew the machine would last 6 or more years,.....it might be a new level in home brewed espresso appreciation.

1299,1,"Previous to this I had purchased a small little 4-cup Mr.Coffee Espresso/Cappuccino machine. I was very happy with it but after a year it seemed to spit out fairly bland espresso. I decided to hit a few stores and snatched this model up for $59 on sale at Target.<br /><br />First and foremost if you have any odd questions about the machine, this FAQ is a nice place to start =)<br />[...]<br /><br />Unlike my previous Mr. Coffee, this machine uses pressure as oppose to steam. I notice a big difference in the flavor and the perfect crema this machine produces. Where the previous machine lacked in those areas. Sadly the only downfall to this model is it only does 2 shots at a time, where I liked having the option of doing four to serve more people. But, oh well.<br /><br />The unit is pretty well built and includes everything but a decanter, any cups or demitasse cups should do. I also recommend removing the rubbery piece from the frothing tip and just using the metal itself. It's a pain to clean but easier to use and less likely to get bacteria.<br /><br />One of the major things I read about is these machines leaking, I found via the FAQ above that the drip tray collect all excess water from the machine once it is ran. Thus the drip tray needs to be emptied after each use. Some people were letting the tray build up until it overflowed I guess. The machine can be a little noisy with it's clunking patterns but is to be expected from any pressure based machines I have seen. (You'll get used to it.)<br /><br />The espresso comes out nice and creamy, the frothing wand does a great job, and I really enjoy that this machine has a reservoir and doesn't need to be refilled for every batch made. On a side note, since there is a reservoir you need to stop the machine at the right moment or else you will keep spewing out espresso and A) Make a mess, and B) have watered down drivel. After a few tries you will get the hang of how much espresso you need spit out for one shot or two, try to stick to using the same decanter or demitasse cups.<br /><br />The machine's buttons are used in steps, first the power, then wait for the green check mark light to go solid, then choose either the foam icon or the coffee cup. Then turn the side dial to choose which one. If you do it out of order or don't wait for the green check mark to light up first then it just all starts to blink. Kind of like an error code. Your best bet is to take it slow, it's a touch convoluted but worth it in the end for the kind of espresso/cappuccino this machine puts out.<br /><br />Overall I highly recommend this machine for any coffee fans.<br /><br />Ease of Use: B (A little convoluted but you will get the hang of it)<br />Aesthetics: A (Not a bad looking entry level machine at all)<br />Espresso: A+ (Excellent coffee, excellent crema (foam on top of espresso) as long as you know when to stop it.)<br />Foam: A+ (Will take practice but it makes a nice foam once you skim it on the top of the milk, I use lactaid or fat free half and half btw)<br />Maintenance: B+ (The drip tray needs to be emptied, and you need to clean the frothing wand after each use as well.)<br />Price: A  ($59 was a good price for me)<br />Footprint:A (looks smaller in person as oppose to the box, which is great.

1301,1,"I picked this espresso maker up on Black Friday for $25. I've always liked espresso but usually when I get it in a coffee house or restaurant, it has a certain harshness to it. I always figured it was because the beans they used were old or they weren't packing the grounds properly, resulting in overextraction of parts of it.<br /><br />So, today I tried making an espresso and latte. I ran water through the machine with no grounds to warm the machine up and see how it worked. Then I added some fine grounds to the 2 cup mark, packing it with a shot glass. Added the water, closed it, and turned it on. Within ~30 seconds I had espresso with a beautiful brown crema. Tasted rich and felt creamy in my mouth. No harshness.<br /><br />Next, I tried making the latte. I added cold milk and a food thermometer to a small glass, packed the grounds with the bottom of a shot glass, and started it up. Spit out another beautiful espresso and then I turned on the steam function. Got a really frothy milk and stopped it at 150 Fahrenheit. Poured the milk into the espresso and it was heavenly. Had a foam layer on top for those who like to do latte art.<br /><br />This machine is extremely easy to use. I ran two water-only cycles, an espresso, a latte, and cleaned the machine in under 10 minutes on my first try (never made espresso before at all). That said, always read your instructions. I think a lot of the problems that other reviewers are having are due either to not reading the instructions or just plain 'ole not being very competent with using appliances.<br /><br />Some tips I can think of:<br />1) run a water-only cycle to warm the machine up.<br />2) grind and pack your beans properly. This should be a no-brainer, but will make the difference between just being concentrated coffee, overextracted espresso, and perfect espresso. A good burr grinder will help with this.<br />3) either buy a tamper or use something other than the flat spoon they provide for tamping. I used a tall shot glass with straight sides. I'm waiting on my tamper to arrive in the mail.<br />4) use common sense when steaming. This is pressurized steam. It's a lot hotter than boiling water. Though if you manage to burn yourself, you're doing something wrong. It's that simple to use.<br />5) buy your beans from a roastery. Not only are you supporting a local business, but the beans will be magnitudes fresher and better tasting. If you use beans from the grocery store, they were probably roasted weeks, if not months ago. At my local roasterery, I can buy a bag of beans that's still warm.<br /><br />Feel free to ask me any questions. I highly recommend the Mr. Coffee ECM160 espresso maker. I made better espresso on my first try with this little guy than the baristas with $1,000 machines at restaurants I've been to. While I'm sure a lot of that is due to poor bean quality, it just shows you what this machine is capable of doing, and at a price considerably cheaper than what you'd expect. I know some folks think that only a pump espresso machine can produce a crema, and maybe the more intense pressure from a pump machine does produce a better crema, but I had no trouble getting one with this steam espresso machine.",5,2011-11-28,13.0,,,What a great machine!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

That being said, I discovered just using the stainless steel pitcher with a battery operated handheld frother that I already had, also produced amazing froth.  So if I had to do over again, I probably would  not buy the machine, and just use the handheld frother with the stainless steel pitcher, adding the froth to my coffee.

Mr. Coffee does not even sell one that will work with the machine.  My advise is to take out the mug holder (where the coffee cup sits)  and slid a mug in there be carefull of the height and the width can not make a 16oz tall coffee cup at all . must be short and not take big on the bottom. E-mailed Mr Coffee and told them where the slider goes it should be level than could fit a better cup, You will need to be careful of which mugs you use.<br />Pros.

Anything more than a finger's worth of milk boils over the edge of the container (purchased separately), and what does get streamed is lukewarm at best.<br /><br />- in the less than two months it's been in use, the plastic lid of the decanter has cracked because of the heat. Mr. Coffee doesn't offer replacement parts, just the full decanter itself, and it's not worth $10 to get a lid that cost them $0.20.

I ran water through two more times noting that the metal reservoir is what reeked of chemical smells.  2nd espresso just as bitter and chemical tasting.  I ran water through it 10 MORE TIMES  which was very time consuming and still my 3rd espresso attempt tastes like poison. Just ew.  So now, I have an expensive milk steamer that can't make espresso.

1385,1,"For the price point, this is a great little machine. I bought this machine to learn on and have since moved on to something high quality, but I used this little guy daily for almost 5 months. It's pretty fool proof because of the pressurized baskets, if you tamp finely ground coffee in there you WILL pull espresso. That being said, I found a few things that made a big difference:<br />1) You HAVE to keep this thing clean. I ran water through the grouphead and wiped it with a towel after every single shot. It gets clogged very easily and you'll see the difference in your extraction. Place a cup underneath the shower head (no portafilter) and run water through it. If you don't see water sprinkling out evenly, and instead see one stream of water coming out, you need to wipe it down.<br />2) The quality of the actual machinery inside only goes so far, so I found that using a more oily bean produced better crema and shot quality. This is a double-edged sword because an oiler bean will also clog the shower head more easily. But, as stated above, just keep it clean. I didn't have a separate grinder and I found the Starbucks espresso roast, pre-ground (GASP, I know), worked just fine for me.<br />3) I bought a separate tamper. The best way to gauge how much coffee should be in the basket is with a traditional tamper (the top edge of the tamper should be level with the basket). You can't do this with the little plastic one that comes with it, it's too thin.<br />4) I can't say much about the steam wand because I was using non-dairy milk the whole time. Never got micro foam with soy milk, but I'm not sure that's the machine's fault, non dairy milk is just tricky to work with. I WILL say that I easily get micro foam with the same milk using the Breville machine I have now.<br /><br />I loved that this machine had manual extraction. It worked as a great teaching tool, because it forces you to look at the flow rate, color, and consistency of your shot and judge when to stop it. My Breville pulls an automatic shot, which you CAN reprogram, but it's just a bit of a different experience.<br /><br />Note: I had a tough time priming this machine when I first got it, and initially thought it was DOA. Just the sound of the pump working but no steam being produced. If you experience this, try *firmly* placing the water tank into the machine. After I kind of jammed it in there (after saying, okay, I'll try one more time), a bunch of bubbles escaped and I was able to prime (aka, steam came out).<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful beginner machine and I'd recommend it to anyone!",4,2017-12-15,4.0,True,,this is a great little machine,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
1386,1,"I bought this machine back in June '17<br /><br />pros: It makes greats espresso as long as you get the right grind level. I use a manual conical burr grinder that i use for both espresso and french press level grounds so i tend to miss the correct mark from time to time when switching back.  it gets good flavor out of the beans.<br /><br />love the tank on the back, my last espresso maker didn't have one.<br /><br />love that you don't have to repressurize a chamber to brew the next cup.<br /><br />cons: the frothing wand isn't very well designed.<br /><br />it doesn't get as hot as it should when frothing the milk. so when you pour it into the coffee it cools it down to much and then it isn't really hot anymore. which puts it at my personal preferred temp, buy my wife prefers to it be at the proper temp that you would get if you'd gone to a coffee shop so we end up sticking hers in the microwave, which then also hurts the flavor of the coffee itself.<br /><br />also, you can't use the want with the rubber cover that is supposed to go on it bc at that point all it does is spit water instead of actually aerating the milk to make it frothy.  i can get it to froth much better bare. but again, doesn't get it hot enough.<br /><br />but given the price point of the machine, I didn't expect it to be perfect, but i did hope it to be a little better.<br /><br />Update - I've had it for ayear now, frothing side no longer works as of yesterday. I cleaned the machine off inthe sink to get all the coffee ground dust and such off it.  I can still brew the coffee, but i can no longer get it to switch to the frothing setting.

The milk reservoir prevents waste of unused steamed milk, it is super easy to attach and detach. I also love the different settings for espresso/cappuccino/latte. Another thing I love is that if my kids want hot cocoa I can easily just steam them milk to have a coffee house style hot cocoa, way better than just making it with hot water.<br />The machine is a little loud but I don't mind at all because I know that it is making an amazing cup of coffee. It heats up fast which is also great since some mornings I am running out the door in a hurry and don't have a bunch of time to wait while the machine heats up.<br /><br />There are a few things I would change if I could: First one being that there was an indicator light letting you know when the water reservoir is low and needs to be filled. I have it stilling under a shelf on my counter so it is hard to see the water level and often times I forget to check until it has started making the espresso. Another thing I wish was different was that it could fit a to-go tumbler. We always drink coffee from those since the coffee stays hot longer and there is no way to make them fit. Instead I have to make the coffee in a mug and transfer it to the tumbler. These two things are minor  and not deal breakers for me.<br /><br />One last comment: ALWAYS remember to aim the steamer spout into the cup or mug.

1424,1,"Overall I am very pleased with the machine, especially the espresso and latte features.  The frothing is really loud, just like at a coffee shop. I haven't tried the cappuccino setting yet.  There are a few things about the design that I think are important to point out.<br /><br />Filling the water container is easy, but you must either pull the entire unit away from the wall, or reach behind the machine to remove the water tank.  You then must open the lid to access the handle, just a bit awkward.<br /><br />The milk reservoir is very handy in that I can save any extra milk in the fridge until I need it again the next day. The machine will heat it up as it froths, so you can use the milk right out of the refrigerator. However, an issue with the milk container is how hard it can be to get connected and removed from the unit.  If the milk container is not properly in place, the cappuccino and latte lights will blink.  It was difficult to find the note about this in the users manual (it wasn't in the troubleshooting section).  After brewing coffee, it can be difficult to then remove the milk container for storage in the fridge.<br /><br />Finally, the espresso filter can be difficult to get on/off due to a very tight seal.  The products produced thus far (espresso, latte) are very good and as good, if not better, than most purchased products such as Starbucks, Caribou, etc.  Cleaning the machine is relatively easy and quick.  Having a ""cleaning"" setting for the milk reservoir is great.

The first unit lasted about 3 months.  The metal steaming tip broke off one day while I was cleaning it (I cleaned the plastic shroud, arm and outside tip every time I used it).  Thankfully the store replaced it with a new unit.  The second machine was good for the next 8 months until the plastic piece that holds the metal band and handle to the carafe broke.  I would estimate I used the 2nd unit between 40 to 50 times.  I washed the carafe in the dishwasher probably 20 times and it still looks almost new.  My next machine will be a different brand, hopefully with more durability.  If you buy this machine plan on buying a steaming pitcher (if you want to make good cappuccino) and a coffee tamper.

I use this thing practically every day, and using it has been nothing but a breeze. Last year, I lived with a friend who had a fully automatic espresso machine, and admittedly that was pretty cool. You'd just keep it stocked with whole beans and water and then getting a couple shots was a matter of pushing one button. Well, I just buy pre-ground espresso and honestly using this thing isn't much harder than that. The water reservoir is pretty big (over a month and a half I have only refilled it once so far), the espresso is plenty strong (honestly, if you're like an 8/10 on the &#34;I like espresso scale&#34; then it will be plenty strong for you..)  The drip tray is great, I've just emptied it once and given it a little rinse. Cleaning the thing after uses is a breeze. If you were looking to make multiple shots in a row that would be a little challenging since the little arm thing would be pretty hot probably, but I'm usually just making one cup at a time so I can let it cool in between.

1487,1,"I bought the Mr Coffee espresso machine after reading reviews on Amazon.  The espresso it makes is okay, but somewhat bitter.  My brother owns a very high end espresso machine.  After visiting him for a long weekend, it took me nearly a week to be able to stand the taste of Mr Coffee espresso again.  I also had the opportunity to taste Mr Coffee espresso in contrast to the Krups steam espresso maker, which is a more apples-to-apples comparison.  It's unfortunate that the reliability of Krups's maker is so poor, because the taste of its espresso is much closer to the high end side.<br /><br />All this would lead me to give the Mr Coffee machine a 3 star rating.  What lowered it to 2 stars was that after only 2 years of use, the espresso/off/steam knob completely broke off, and I have to throw the machine out and buy a new one.  Once it broke, I saw that the mechanism is plastic.  Presumably after a couple of years of heating and cooling, the plastic must have become brittle.  The plastic part just shattered, and there's no way to repair it.  So now I will pay another $39 for a Mr Coffee espresso machine or a little more for a different steam espresso maker, with the knowledge that 2 - 3 years down the line, I'll have to buy another one yet again.<br /><br />Maybe my brother has the right idea ... buy a really quality espresso machine, and never pay again.

1532,1,"Well, I'm surprised this little guy has lasted 2 years, daily use , for one person, I expected it to fall apart, but its still going strong.  I mainly bought this for the steamer, and boy, can it steam, take off the plastic sleeve thingy and use just the metal wand. I steam rice milk, which is the hardest to steam, this make it very bubbly, so make sure to tap out the bubbles a bit.  I use a smaller steaming pitcher, like a 8 oz size, and just steam more as I need it.  If you add a tablespoon of soy milk to your rice milk, it makes it super smooth foam.  And don't use ""light"" rice/soy milk, its too watered down.  I was a barista back in the day, so I know how to work it.  But the espresso this machine makes is not that great, I'm not a espresso connoisseur so I'm fine with it.  Yes, you have to grind the beans finer & I tamp it down firm.  And weirdly enough, when I turn the knob from espresso to steam, the espresso keeps dripping out in big foamy puffs, hmmmm.  I don't advise refilling to make another batch right after the first, it just doesn't seem to work.  Do like a previous reviewer said and fill reservoir with extra water.  Make sure you empty out all the steam inside when your done, its easy to clean the steam wand that way but just putting full water in your steam pitcher and let it heat up, it melts of the milk and wipe it clean when steams done.<br /><br />UPDATE: Dec 2012. It finally broke after 3 years of use. So for the cheap price, I can't complain. I did love the steam wands position & strength, but it never pulled really adequate espresso shots.",5,2011-04-12,,,,"Great steamer, cheap price","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
1533,1,"I bought this Mr. Coffee ECM160 to replace a horrible Krups machine. This Mr. Coffee is a basic, fast espresso machine and makes a decent pot of cappuccino. Price is quite reasonable.<br /><br />1. My biggest gripe is that the two-foot cord is too darn short! And yes, I know it has cord storage in the base. The cord should be at least three feet long so I can situate it properly on the kitchen counter.<br /><br />2. A smaller problem is the design of the smooth tapered cap on top and the smooth rounded knob on the left. The conical shape makes these awkward to handle; standard knurled knobs would be much better.<br /><br />3. Yet another issue is the catch tray under the carafe; an awkward two-part tray that is difficult to separate and clean. Plus the plastic lid fits loosely on the carafe and falls off when you pour the coffee.<br /><br />Poor ergonomics, but decent espresso.<br /><br />UPDATE: After three plus years of reliable service, my Mr. Coffee ECM160 finally died.

I was caught off guard with this one as a gift and I love it. I stopped shopping - I don't care about bars - it does the job.<br /><br />I paid just as much for a stainless steel Italian stove top unit that delivers weaker coffee and is harder to clean.

To be honest, it doesn't leave wishing I had a more expensive one. It renders a moderate amount of ""la crema"".<br /><br />The secret with any espresso maker is the finest ground bean possible.

1539,1,"For those who are seeking an espresso machine that produces an excellent crema and works well this would be an excellent choice. While there are several cheaper espresso machines available, these operate using steam and not pressure and should be avoided. The Mr. Coffee ECMP50 has an actual pump which makes all the difference when good crema is desired. I use lavazza and illy espresso and when ground and tamped properly this machine has sufficient pressure to produce a very nice crema.<br /><br />After reading the reviews for this product I was a little apprehensive at first, but based on some of the other positive reviews I decided to take a chance and purchase this machine. After using this machine for quite some time without any failures I can safely say that this model is a great machine when compared to some of the other more expensive models. While the body is indeed made of plastic, the portafilters, baskets and drip tray grid and steam wand are indeed quality solid metal. It should be noted that the steam wand plastic tip was removed for better (and more sanitary) milk frothing.<br /><br />The majority of the negative comments posted by other consumers are all valid points but if one treats this machine with care and keeps it clean after every use each of these issues can be avoided:<br /><br />-Pertaining to the issues of leaking: The removable reservoir has a small valve at the bottom which is only engaged when the removable reservoir is in place. Make sure this is down all the way before you fill up your water, make sure that the reservoir is completely seated in the base of the machine and there should not be any problems with initial leaking. It should be noted that when the pump purges and cleans itself for the next brew/steam cycle it expels it's contents into the drip tray. When I first purchased the machine and ran the ""water only"" cycle for the steam wand and brew function the drip tray filled up very quickly. Since I empty the drip tray often and makes sure the reservoir is seated properly I have had no issues with any water on my counter.<br /><br />-Pertaining to the machine itself: If you read the manual completely and clean the machine after every use there will be no problems with the pump breaking after only a few uses. To be safe and extend the life of the machine, after I am done making my espressos for the day I remove the reservoir and empty the water, as well as purge remaining water from the wand (the machine does it for you but there is still a little water left in the pump). When turning the machine on again, I prime the pump according to the directions in the manual. By priming the pump according to the directions whenever the machine is turned on and purging the pump when the machine will be turned off you will considerably extend the life of your pump. Keeping the portafilter and brewhead clean of any espresso grounds as well as not storing the portafilter in the brewhead will keep the brewhead itself from eventually leaking.<br /><br />-Pertaining to the cup warmer: the reviews are true, the cup warmer gets lukewarm at best but I have had such excellent results with this machine for the past 6 months, for the price and quality of espresso this is an easy con to look past.<br /><br />Treat this machine with care and maintain it properly, read the manual and get to know the machines quirky functions (what the lights mean). When used properly this machine can produce a shot of espresso that rivals that of a more expensive $100-$300 espresso machine.",5,2010-11-23,3.0,,,Even reading the other reviews I can say this is a great machine,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

1554,1,"I have had this machine for about a week now.  I ordered it on Amazon.  When it came, I read the owners manual twice, and followed the directions for priming.  I have been careful to obey all warnings and suggestions.  When I tried it for the first time, I selected cappuccino. On the milk frother, I turned the dial to 'cappuccino' which means maximum froth.  It filled the cup with coffee, and made a beautiful crema, but the milk-frothing thing never happened.  No steamed milk came out of the tube that sticks out of the milk reservoir.  Then I followed the directions for manually frothing milk.  Still nothing happened.  I looked at the tubes, nothing clogged.  I knew the milk reservoir was locked correctly in place.  The water reservoir was filled to the max, etc, so for the last week, I have not been able to steam/froth milk.  That was disappointing, because actually that was the reason I bought the machine.  So I've just added milk directly to the cappuccino, and it tastes like a latte.  It actually tastes very good.  Another odd thing about this machine.  When I turn it on, the portafilter drips.  It drips before I select cappuccino.  It even drips after the cappuccino is made.  It never stops dripping, so that I actually never know when my drink is done.  It's rather confusing.  One more thing I thought yall might like to know about.  When I first saw this machine on Amazon, it was advertized as $200.  Then, in the same browser, I checked Wall Mart, and the same machine was sold for $130.  Then I happened to go back to Amazon and saw that MAGICALLY, the price for the same machine, NEW was $130.

When I figured out that I could have had my kitchen counters re-done for what I spend at Starbucks in 6 months (!), I knew I had to learn to make my own lattes.<br /><br />I bought this little sweetheart and gave it to the DH for the kids to give me for xmas.  I read all the reviews and the directions, plus looked up Starbucks syrup-pump volumes online.  So I knew there would be no tamper per se (the scoop is the tamper) or pitcher (I just use a ceramic syrup pitcher).

This is the perfect little machine for that. It gets the job done! With that said, I had this for about a week working perfectly until one day I went to froth the milk and noticed, half my milk was missing out of the carafe. Early morning me thought I was going insane. Where could the milk have gone? I thought maybe I had just not put as much milk in as I thought, looked everywhere in case I had a small stroke and poured it out somewhere random. Checked the condensation line on the carafe and I had indeed had more milk in there. Open the water reservoir on the machine and there was my milk. It had inverted pressure and sucked it back up into the maker. I have read a good majority of the reviews on the product and never saw that mentioned, so I am hoping it was just a freak thing. Packed it back up, sent it back to amazon who sent me a new one and have it up and running fine. If this new one works out well I will come back and give more stars, but until it proves its worth, it only gets 3 stars.<br /><br />Update-<br />I have had my replacement maker for a few weeks now.

I suspected initially before purchasing this product that the automatic milk frother wouldn't work as advertised, and was disappointment to be proven correct on that. Also compared to my previous $100 espresso maker, it didn't seem to work any better.

1627,1,"This machine had such potential. I had it for about a month and used it almost every morning for a latte before it quit working.<br /><br />Pro: It was much easier, faster, and quieter than my last espresso machine. I really love it even over the negatives I have below.<br />Pro: self clean cycle is great - I still have some rinsing to do with the milk but this is so much easier than using a traditional milk frother where the milk gets caked on the nozzle.<br /><br />Con: One thing I overlooked when purchasing this is the space for a cup. I use a 32 oz Tervis to travel with my coffee, this doesn't fit in the space. I can tilt it so that it just barely gets the coffee and milk in the cup but I have to stand there and hold the cup the whole time. It doesn't take long, but when i'm trying to get my 2 little ones ready for church, I have better things that I could be doing.<br /><br />Con: Milk Reservoir - i had trouble keeping this from smelling like spoiled milk. i ended up emptying the milk everyday and rinsing it with soapy water and leaving it out to dry. when i stored it in the fridge with milk for the next day, i had to scrub it out once or twice to get it smelling right.<br /><br />Con: it quit working. It started just making noise when I was trying to froth milk and I couldn't get it to make coffee or milk or even run the clean cycle. In frustration, I hit the top of it fairly hard with my fist and it started working. The next morning, I had to hit it twice to get it to make my morning coffee. I don't have time to coax it into doing what it was made to do. I tried to return it but it started having trouble about a week after the 30 day return period on Amazon.

1686,1,"I am in remote location overseas and desired a budget solution to make my own espresso. I bought this machine for the low price to make espresso at the office. Here are a few comments.<br /><br />The machine makes adequate espresso for what it is. You can not expect it to make the same quality drink as a higher brand such as Di Longhi or Saeco.  With the coffee dispensing out of a single drip mechanism, it puts the entire shot in a mini coffee pot.  The coffee has a descent taste to it, a little bitter due to the shot becoming dead while trying to fill the entire pot.  It dispenses with crema(Light colored foamy part of an espresso shot) about half way.  The initial trickle drip is slow and dark and starts to foam about after ten seconds.<br /><br />The coffee will get a slight burnt taste if allowed to drip to the full 4 shot mark on the pot.  This is due to the steam being fully charged near the end of the dispensing. Once you are done the grounds pop out in a nice packed chunk, My only critique of this type of machine, (not just this brand) is that you can not pre-heat the water.  If you wanted to steam the milk first then brew the coffee you can not really do it because there is not enough time to steam the water.  You can only brew coffee first, then turn the lever to the steam position to actuate the wand.  All in all if you are in a pinch and are looking for a quick disposable machine where you can leave it behind without being without some coin this is a good machine for the money.",4,2011-09-03,,True,,It does the job for a low priced machine,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

It will foam the milk for a short time and once the pressure drops, the foam immediately settles. What we found disappointing was that the milk remained cold or lukewarm. The small amount of pressurized steam is not enough to increase the milk temperature to 150 degrees, what the manual claims. We used only a small amount of milk (about 2-3 oz.) straight from the refrigerator and after frothing stopped (and the foam disappeared), the milk temperature was about 80 degrees F. or less.

First of all like all expresso machines periodically  you need to clean the cups and the reservoir every 100-150 brews, I personally use water and white vinagre equal parts and let it run until the reservoir is empty (this may take up to 15 minutes then let it brew again with clean water, do this also with your cups. This will maintain your machine and the quality of your coffee as fresh as the first day.  Remember,  your grinds should be for expresso not brewed.

1797,1,"Overall, especially for the price, this is a good product. It's my first espresso machine so I have nothing to compare it to. My only complaint is that on my fourth use, the plastic cover on the frothing arm melted. I like the milk pretty hot so I may have steamed it too long. Mr. Coffee is replacing the part, but I see this being an ongoing problem. I wish that the machine had a frothing arm made of a material that would not melt. I was instructed not to use the frother without the plastic cover, but I think I might try that anyway.<br /><br />I'm updating this review and taking one star away. The espresso is fine, it's the frother that is sort of a nightmare. I've tried all different pitchers and containers to froth the milk in, and it splashes everywhere. There is a strong burning plastic smell. I thought it was when the frothing arm melted, but I used it again and was careful not to steam the milk too long, and it still had that smell. Not sure what is burning, but I'm sure I will figure it out after a few more uses.

1799,1,"There are so many informative reviews, like L. Hamilton's, that I don't need to rehash them.  I bought mine for my girlfriend to use as I didn't like coffee.  Everything I tried from Starbucks tasted like acid.  Along with the unit I ordered some well reviewed Lavazza Gusto espresso bricks.  Within minutes I loved coffee (at least the coffee I make).  I have since settled on Lavazza Rossa as my go-to blend.  Pure arabica doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Does mine leak?  Yes. When I forget to empty the tray.  Every time the frother is used the leftover water in the steam tank gets purged into the tray and I sometimes forget about this hidden water filling it up.<br /><br />Does my water tank leak? No.  I could see that tank seal getting worn from constantly removing the tank.  I fill it in place and only remove it for occasional cleaning.  If yours is leaking due to wear, smear a dab of silicone plumbers grease around the inlet on the machine that the seal goes over to fill in scratches from use.<br /><br />Is there water under the unit?  Occasionally from the steam purge as the tray spout is not air tight.  I have sponges for that.<br /><br />Does it froth well?  Yes. I took off the rubber tip and put it in the junk drawer as it's another item to clean.  I can easily froth whole milk, 2%, skim, half & half, and soy milk whether it's chilled or not.<br /><br />Does super tamping help or really matter? Not that I can tell and over tamping puts strain on the pump.  Unlike commercial machines, the included filter baskets force the coffee through a pinhole on the bottom of the filter to produce the crema. Heavy packing is not necessary or desirable. Firm is fine.<br /><br />The only addition I made was an aluminum tamper as coffee likes to stick to the included plastic one.<br /><br />Take reasonable care and keep it clean.  Form a routine, including the Dance of the Buttons (stolen from another review) and all will be well.<br /><br />1. Check tank and add water as needed.<br />2. Make your shots.  Press steam button after last shot as it takes a bit to get ready.<br />3. Do your frothing.  Clean the frother immediately after the last batch as the milk will cook on the tip (if you have removed the rubber thingie) and the stem.  If you let it go and the milk has hardened, grab a warm damp sponge and wrap it around the tip for a few seconds until the milk is soft and wipe the tip.  There will be a whiteish ring on the tip where it meets the stem.  That's the rubber sealer for the tip so don't scrub it off.<br />4. Run the frother again in open air to clear out the nozzle and sterilize the frother.<br />5. Rinse out the filter and handle.<br />6. Run the brewer again without the handle in place for a few seconds to rinse off the brew screen.<br />7. Empty and rinse the drip tray.<br />8. Enjoy some fine coffee.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a bit to go through each time you use the machine but the coffee is great and worth it to me for what I paid.  Run some Lavazza Rossa, or any fine coffee, through it and you probably won't drink another Starbucks, again.<br /><br />Tip:  I like to make cold coffee and cappuccino and hate the grittiness if I have to add sugar. I make up a batch of simple sugar syrup and keep it in a squeeze bottle by the machine.  Brew - squirt - froth - drink.<br /><br />My apologies if folks are offended by some of this but some people just don't use common sense.<br /><br />Remember, this is a budget priced home 15 BAR machine that just happens to make great coffee.  You're not gonna get a Rolex for 80 bucks.  Your gonna get a mass produced somewhat flimsy item and the occasional lemon.  Get over it.<br /><br />This unit was bought last year and put to daily use without issue or regret.<br /><br />The only time I had to contact Mr. Coffee about a product, it was out of warranty and they treated me right.<br /><br />If mine breaks I will get another if nothing else is outstandingly better in this price range by then.

I use a chopstick to coax the 2 rubber nipples into the brew head and the divider comes out.  Swipe some cooking oil onto the nipples to make putting it back in much easier.  I'll post a pic or two if I can.<br /><br />There is a ""Stainless steel 2 cup incremental measuring cup, 1 pc"" that I found here that works a treat as a frothing cup. It's the perfect depth.<br /><br />Whew.

I will order another one and see how quickly it gets here and how long it lasts.<br /><br />This is the third or fourth Mr. Coffee machine that I have purchased over the last 10 years.  It is not a genuine espresso machine because it doesn’t work off the vacuum principle. Consequently, it will not produce a nice rich crema.<br /><br />However, while they don’t last longer than two or three years, they are capable of producing the strongest coffee of any coffee maker that I’ve used in the quantity that I want.  Most of the espresso machines are designed for a very small quantities, but this comes with a fairly large deep coffee basket, so you can make a lot of good strong coffee.

Some things about frothing I've found:  1) Start with cold milk (and if your pitcher is metal, freeze it first). This helps keep the milk from scalding. 2)Bring the milk up to the proper temperature before you start building the foam (that's where the thermometer helps).  3) Make sure you clean the wand immediately afterward with a blast of leftover steam (one reason why people may have leftover water), otherwise the milk dries inside the thin wand and blocks it (maybe why people say the wand doesn't work after 1 or a few tries).

1830,1,"This is an excellent little machine!  My husband and I have had ours for 6 months and just love it.  It's the first espresso/latte machine we've owned and we found it very easy to use.  We haven't been to the local coffee place (****bucks) since we purchased it and we figured out that with the money we're saving, it's paid for itself several times over!  We have friends who have purchased more expensive machines that are much more complicated to use and this machine makes espresso and lattes that are just as good or better!  Plus, they've had problems with their machines and this one just keeps on going.  You'll need to purchase a frothing pitcher if you want to make lattes, and I suggest a kitchen thermometer to go with it. (You want to be sure the milk gets hot enough or your lattes will be lukewarm. I suggest bringing the milk up to 150 to 160 degrees before adding it to the espresso.) Another tip:  Getting the hang of frothing the milk is really not hard.  It just took a couple of times for my husband and I to figure it out.  If you don't feel comfortable running the frothing tip along the surface of the milk (this will make more foam and is fun to do once you get the hang of it) then just keep the tip completely submerged in the milk until it comes up the proper temperature.  Just move the pitcher around so that the milk heats evenly.  Submerging the tip the whole time will keep you from making a mess until you get the hang of how the frothing tip works.  We purchase flavored syrups from our local grocery store and every morning we have lattes that taste just like the ones we used to pay $7 for!  I highly recommend this machine!!",5,2010-05-05,2.0,,,You get more than you pay for!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

The tube is very light and easily lost in the process of washing (check comments on the Mr. Coffee website and you will discover this is a common problem). Although the part only costs $1.99,  it is not in stock, and hasn't been in stock for several weeks. What is worse is that there is no indication that it will ever be in stock again. Advice from customer services is to &#34;keep checking the website&#34;, but that doesn't put coffee in my cup when I need it.  I can understand running out of an item, but reviews that have been left make it clear that this has been an ongoing issue.

1846,1,"Having very recently returned the other, let's say &#34;Brand X&#34; sub-$100 pump-driven espresso machine that had 4+ stars, I was hyper-aware of the features and improvements I was looking for. This machine has hit almost all of them with just one issue that might be my fault. This unit does come with two (non-serviceable) filter sizes for single and double shots. It does not include a spoon or a tamper. Like most pump systems, it's a little noisier than a drop machine but not that bad.<br /><br />Cup space. First thing I noticed was this unit is a little larger than the Brand X unit. I was able to fit a medium-small sized coffee mug under the filter so the need for tiny espresso cups is not so urgent. It does make it a little harder to see how much espresso you're making but you can tune yourself to what looks right. I also noticed my cups don't go sliding across the tray like they did on the Brand X model.<br /><br />Frother: A major annoyance of the Brand X model was the frother was spring-loaded/activated. This made it feel like a juggling act with the very real risk of burning yourself. This unit has a normal swing out frother (no springs) and to activate it, you simply turn the knob to &#34;steam&#34;. Very simple and all you need. It produces a good foam and the rubber tip comes off easily for cleaning. The height of the frother also allows you to use a normal mug instead of some special tiny frothing cup like Brand X required.<br /><br />Filter handle: Another issue with Brand X was the filter was very difficult to seat fully. You had to be very strong to get it to the fully locked position and I rarely bothered to get it that far. This unit is much much easier to get to the fully locked position even with a full basket of grounds.<br /><br />The one issue I seem to have is it doesn't get very hot, but it might be my cups not being pre-heated and the slow drip in a 66 degree house is just too much to keep it hot. The espresso still tastes wonderful and it's been very easy to use a normal mug for the entire process. Preheating is very quick (within a minute or two) and brewing is just a quick.<br /><br />For the price and simplicity of this unit, I highly recommend it.",5,2015-02-06,,True,,Fantastic deal and my favorite of the two options with this feature-set and price,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

Upon tasting it, the plastic flavor was so strong I had to spit it out and dump the coffee.  I tried running plain water through at least a dozen times more with no luck, still had the horrible plastic flavor.  I left the cap off for a couple months hoping to air it out, no luck.  I followed the instructions from the Mr. Coffee site to put vinegar in the water storage to rid the unit of the plastic flavor, no luck.  After all this, my chance to return it was way past, now it is going in the trash.

(of course, even the best machines won't make a good cup of espresso if you don't start with GOOD coffee, properly ground)... I definitely recommend it.  HOWEVER: The steaming wand on my machine clogged after a few months of use... there aren't any instructions or anything about cleaning the steaming wand... let me make a few suggestions that I have mostly figured out by myself, with little or no help from Mr. Coffee:<br /><br />The cover for the wand is unnecessary and bothersome.  Just remove it and don't bother.<br /><br />The tip of the wand unscrews and can be cleaned separately.  Do that often.  You may have to use a pair of pliers to &#34;break it loose&#34; and to tighten it sufficiently when you put it back on-- there is supposedly a built-in &#34;wrench&#34; on the handle of the measuring scoop, but it may or may not actually be effective. It's probably necessary to clean the steaming wand tip often (definitely every use, force some steam out of the wand when you're done to 'blow it clear'...<br /><br />Mr. Coffee recommends that you delime the machine every 40-80 brews, same as with a regular coffeemaker (use vinegar, then flush with clear water a few times)... clean the steaming wand tip at least this often-- probably much more often.<br /><br />You probably want to put a cup or something under the steaming wand while you are waiting for it to get up to temp/pressure... water will drip, the steam will be &#34;wet,&#34; etc. while you're waiting...<br /><br />Overall, a decent machine and certainly a good machine for the money.",4,2014-07-20,2.0,True,,Works great... needs better maintenance instructions,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

1895,1,"I waited sometime before writing this review so that I can give you my most honest opinion about the item.<br /><br />Before giving you some pros and cons, let it be known that I had to return the first espresso maker that was sent to me because it had a major water leak. Upon first use, I noticed that the machine was leaking from the bottom, which was reducing the water pressure and very likely creating some electric shock hazard. I took a peek inside the machine to see if the issue could be easily resolved but what I saw in there was an almost 100% plastic construction, some poor quality components and somewhat weak-looking water tubes. Anyway, this was to be expected given the price range of this espresso maker.<br /><br />Once I received a new one, I could immediately notice the difference. The water pressure was fine on this one and there were no leaks. I'll now list some pros and cons for this machine following two months of using it once or twice a day to make espressos, cappuccinos and lates.<br /><br />PROS<br />--------<br />- Can't beat that price. As far as I'm concerned, there is no other product in this price range that works as well as the mr. coffee's barista.<br />- It has a very compact build, it's small and will fit any kitchen.<br />- Very easy to use, clean and maintain.<br />- While its espressos are not on pair with those made by high end espresso makers, they are actually quite good.<br />- I like not having to handle the milk frother by hand, this machine is quite convenient.<br /><br />CONS<br />--------<br />- Inconsistency! I am entirely convinced that this machine lacks consistency in terms of how much milk is frothed when it's preparing a drink, small or large. I typically use the same cup when preparing small lates (Bormioli Rocco Verdi Cappuccino Cup with Stainless Steel Handle). Sometimes the drink will only fill up about 3/4 of the cup, while some other times it will fill it up to the top, and then make some more foam and a big mess along with it.<br />- Inconsistency #2. While it's nice having an automatic frother, I feel like I can never trust it. Adjusting the milk dial to make a late (low froth) will often work as expected but other times it won't, and you will end up with some (or a lot) of unwanted froth in your cup.<br />- Milk frother often rebels and decides to spit milk in all kinds of directions. While most of it will go into the cup, some won't, so... be ready to spend a few extra minutes cleaning it.<br />- Construction is almost 100% plastic as expected. Given the leak issue of my first machine, however, I can only assume that this thing is not that sturdy.<br /><br />Despite the cons above, I would recommend this machine because of its convenience factor, the price, and the fact that in the end, it does make a very good cup of espresso/cappuccino.",4,2013-09-08,3.0,True,,"Compact, convenient, makes good espresso but has annoying shortcomings","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

Is it worth spending 15 minutes making your own latte on a machine that will require you to make maybe 100 lattes before you see a return on your investment, or is it easier to go to the coffee shop and buy one?<br /><br />Pros:<br />Nice pressurized espresso dispenser, can tamp to your hearts delight without causing the machine to strain<br />Milk container can be refrigerated<br />Functions well<br /><br />Cons:<br />Water tank appears to be Polycarbonate (likely has BPA), don't store water in it (directions say not to as well)<br />Significant effort to make a latte/cappuccino.<br />Won't handle heavy cream, but half and half is okay.<br /><br />Basic process:<br />Turn on machine, add water to tank, grind coffee, put in filter, tamp as hard as you can (I use stainless steel tamper, not flimsy plastic one included), put filter in holder, attach holder to machine, fill milk tank.  Machine might be ready to go by this time, press button according to what you want.  Takes only 30 seconds or a minute at most.  Pretty fast.  It is the prep/cleanup which takes the longest.  Once you are done, turn the froth knob to clean and press and hold the cappuccino button and let it run hot water through the steamer.  Make sure to have an empty cup under the milk spout.  Repeat to fill a 15 oz travel mug (I have to basically make 4 shot latte, I fill the 2 cup filter twice).<br /><br />Again, I love this machine, but consider if it is worth the effort to you.  If you make a latte every day, it might be, but if you just have one every week or two I would probably stick to buying them at the store to avoid having to have the machine around taking up space.

1927,1,"I bought this as a replacement to a similar Bella espresso machine that still works, but brews really slow. This machine only worked the first time water was ran through it. Every other time its been used, water leaks out of the chamber/tank inside the unit. It appears the water tank inside the machine might not be sealed right or whatever sealant was used weakened and degraded after hot water passed through it. I was hoping the leak was from me not securing the attachment with the coffee grounds in it tight enough, but this isn't the case. I made sure it was snug and secure and watched the unit while it went through the brewing process and saw water seeping through the seams. Only about half of the water put into the unit process through to the espresso. The other half of the water leaked out and covered the counter top. It's a shame this is such poor quality.

1933,1,"After reading the reviews I decided to get the Mr Coffee ECMP50 Espresso maker due to price and overall high reviews.<br /><br />The first machine I bought failed.  It would not brew anything darker then a light tan, I tried different tampering, different ground and nothing.  The machine leaked like a crazy leaving water all over the counter.  I reread and reread and reread the instructions and it just wouldn't work so I took it back to Target and exchanged it for the same model.<br /><br />The new model I got I noticed right away before even opening the box it was different; the 2nd model came in a (shades) of brown colored box and the 1st came in a pinkish/lavender colored box.  I didn't think too much about it till I got home and started brewing an espresso...this one worked!  Dark rich flavored espresso, howbeit not quite as good as a top Italian restaurant but as good as Starbucks, the crema is a little weak but the coffee is flavorable.  I also noticed no leakage whatsoever.  I only make espresso's and don't care for cappuccino's or latte's thus I don't froth so I can't comment on that aspect.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars due to the first bad machine and potential quality control issues, weak crema, flavor not quite up to par but at least as good as Starbucks, and a good value compared to other espresso makers.<br /><br />So far after only a couple of uses I'm happy.  I have read some reviews where the purchaser had the same problems I did, I can only assume, although I could be wrong, that you find one in the brown box and not the pinkish/lavender box.<br /><br />This is an up date effective 5/14/12.<br /><br />I bought this coffee maker on 9/16/10, on 5/14/12 the pump failed.  This coffee maker is barely a year an half old.  Thus for such an inferior product design I changed my rating of it from a 3 to a 1, and would have rated it zero stars but they don't allow you to go that low.  Did it make good coffee? yes, not the best that really expensive espresso makers can make, but your not spending a lot for it either; but for any product to fail just after 19 months is just darn right bad.  Another made in China product that fails to last for any length of time.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS COFFEE MAKER if you want to last longer then 2 years.",1,2010-09-16,13.0,,,Espresso machine,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

Use the standard 1 Tablespoon of grounds tampered to 1 oz. water (2 Tablespoons). Less water makes a sweeter brew and more water highlights the bitter taste coffee can have. Oh, and buy a tamper. If you are going to steam milk to make cappuccinos or lattes buy a metal frothing cup and remove the plastic cap on your frother to get the best results.

1996,1,"I wanted to love this machine - I already had the Saeco Via Venezia, but the manual-ness was a turn off (had to manually stop the shots from being pulled and had to use a thermometer when steaming milk and stop it when it reached the right temperature). I had actually put the machine away for about 6 years!!<br /><br />I visited my cousin who had the Cafe Barista and was in awe that all you needed to do was press a button and voila, your latte/cappuccino/espresso was made for you - automatically! I was intrigued so I purchased this to compare it with my Via Venezia.<br /><br />First off, if you have nothing to compare the Cafe Barista to, it seems like like a well-made product. However, since I had the Via Venezia, which is made in Italy, the parts and pieces were so much more well made! The housing of the Cafe Barista was plastic whereas the VV was stainless steel. The handle of the portafilter (the gadget you put the espresso in) was plastic as well, where the VV had a nice rubber grip. All little things you wouldn't ordinarily notice unless comparing side-by-side with something else. I was concerned the Cafe Barista wouldn't last very long because of the plastic components.<br /><br />On to the differences in how it makes espresso/latte: I use soy milk and by nature, it doesn't foam/steam easily (I worked in Starbucks so I know how to properly foam using a steaming wand). The Cafe Barista's foam using soy lacked depth and thickness and it just tasted like a thin soy milk; no froth at all, even when I set it to the max. I went as far as going out and getting whole milk to see if it was just the soy that was producing mediocre foam. While the whole milk did produce better foam than soy, there was still much to be desired.... It just wasn't right. I had to manually turn on the foaming contraption again after the automatic setting ran its course to get more foam (just to be clear, I'm not snooty about foam - I don't like cappuccinos bc it's too foamy. I am just looking for nice, thick latte foam!). With the VV, I have a lot more control on how the milk is steamed/frothed and my soy milk would be perfect - right thickness (not watery) and the foam was smooth and rich, not bubbly and airy like what the Cafe Barista gave me.<br /><br />The shots. I don't really have much to say about comparing the two - they both pulled very similar shots of espresso and I could barely taste the difference. Again, I like the fact that the Cafe Barista pulled the shots with a press of a button and stopped when it was done. I didn't like having to watch over the VV and have to stop it manually. With that said, espresso shots only last about 10 seconds before they turn bitter and gross, so I guess the manual setting wasn't that big of a deal.<br /><br />The cleanup. The VV was fairly easy to clean - just empty and wash the portafilter, the drip tray if necessary, and the steam wand if you used it. I would run empty water and steam through the wand first to get all the gunk out in case there was still milk trapped inside, then I'd detach and wash. Easy peasy. With the Cafe Barista, there was more to be washed - the portafilter, the milk container, the wand that pours the milk into your mug, and if I remember correctly, there was also a rubber tube that fed milk into the wand. You don't want milk or anything getting hardened and stuck in these as it'll be hard to clean later and you'll be having gross milk.<br /><br />Anyway, looooooong story short (too late, right?) I felt the VV was a better fit for my needs and I already had it (didn't need to spend more on another machine). Since I worked for Starbucks, I got the VV at my discount. Had I not had the discount, I prooooobably wouldn't have purchased it for the $300+ it goes for and would settle for something that had a steam wand (i hear Mr. Coffee has one!) instead of an automatic frother contraption.",3,2016-04-03,4.0,True,,I have the Saeco Via Venezia and I prefer that ...,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

2029,1,"I was skeptical before purchasing this item; it's inexpensive and the reviews were not fabulous, but I wanted an espresso maker and we 9husbanad and I) couldn't afford one, so this was the only option.  We took the plunge and I'm happy we did.  This little thing has turned out to be fantastic!  I don't know how we lived with out it. We have owned this product for nearly 6 months and here are my tips:<br />1- Buy the temper so you can pack the espresso bean<br />2- the pitcher is worth buying but isn't totally necessary (you can use a coffee mug if you really wanted to, the pitcher is more convenient)<br />3- clean the maker every time you use it, but it is especially important to clean the milk steamer every time you use it because you can get build-up (you would have to do this with every espresso maker)<br />4- Give the maker a really good clean about every week.  I put water through it a few times, it doesn't take long.<br />5- make sure you use all the water every time you use it<br />6- don't over-fill anything<br /><br />Don't be alarmed! These tasks are typical up-keep for any espresso maker. Believe me, the little extra work is worth it since you can get up every morning to a latte or cappuccino without paying the crazy prices at a coffee shop.<br /><br />p.s.

2173,1,"For $40 this is a good espresso machine.  Very simple, easy to clean, measured amounts.  It lasted us over 2 years with a good 1-4 uses per day.  The only reason we threw it away is because the side knob handle broke off.  Otherwise it was still functioning.  The side knob pole that goes from the knob to the machine is made of plastic and ripped off the hinge.  So one thing to be careful on is to always hold the knob at the base and turn it slowly to avoid damage.  The day it broke I was in a rush and grabbed it at the tip and twisted the internal plastic pole.  I suspect over time more crap got into the metal and made it harder to turn.  But I will admit I wasnt very good about cleaning it, too lazy.  When the coffee tasted like crap is when I ran the vinegar and cleaning instructions... bad espresso machine owner, BAD!<br /><br />But I feel the ""Mr. Coffee ECMP50 Espresso/Cappuccino Maker, Black"" is a superior product and 100% worth the $80 they are asking.

2174,1,"For years now I've thought about purchasing an espresso machine to be able to get my caffeine ""fix"" at home without having to spend $4/drink out at the mega-chain, but I never followed-through.  Late last year, my nearby mega-chain started becoming VERY inconsistent with its drinks.  Quality control had drastically gone downhill, and even after speaking with management, nothing changed.  I made the decision to purchase one, but imagine my surprise when this espresso machine was given to me by my bf as an early Christmas gift!<br /><br />First off, my unit has no leaks whatsoever.  This machine heats up very quickly and is ready to go in no time flat.  It took a little bit of time to get my ""technique"" down, but now I can consistently make my favorite drinks as good if not BETTER than the mega-chain.  Between my bf and I, this machine has already paid for itself.  I did the math, and when taking into account the cost of all the ingredients (espresso, a flavoring syrup, and milk) a grande-size drink made at home costs around $0.80 compared to the $4+ at the mega-chain!<br /><br />A couple of tips:  Get a nice tamper, the one that comes with it is just plastic and you really cant get a great tamp with it (and a good tamp is important).  You don't have to spend a lot one one, the one I purchased was only $7 here on Amazon.  You'll also want a nice frothing pitcher -- stainless steel is best (and put it in the freezer for a minute or two before ya froth, it helps!).  Also pick up a thermometer, as you want to make sure you don't over-steam the milk otherwise it will go bad on ya (personally I steam up to about 150 degrees).<br /><br />Perfect ""Triple Grande Skinny Vanilla Latte"":  3oz of espresso, 3 squirts of sugar-free Torani Vanilla, and about 10oz of skim milk.  Top with foam, sprinkle a little cinnamon on top, and enjoy!  BTW, the Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla is 100x better than the sugar-free from the mega-chain.  No weird after-taste from the Torani, it tastes just like it was made with real sugar.

So, NOTHING is more important to me first thing in the morning than getting a quick, easy, perfect cappuccino. Seriously. Nothing.<br /><br />When my third Krupp's espresso machine died after years of heavy use, I decided to change things up. I bought a Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-cup Steam Espresso Machine and at the same time, bought a Capresso espresso machine. This way, we have one at home and one in our RV.<br /><br />I chose the Capresso because I ADORE another product from Capresso: Mllk Froth Pro (You simply pour the milk into the non-stick, easy-clean pitcher, and press start. It's perfect every time and frees me up to feed the cats while the espresso and milk froth are in the making.)  I chose the Mr. Coffee simply because it was the maker of my first drip coffee machine which lasted for decades. It's a name I know and trust.<br /><br />Even tho the Capresso was $10-15 more expensive, the Mr. Coffee choice is by far the best. It takes up less space on the counter and less space vertically. Its lid is crazy easy to open and close in a hurry, while the Capresso lid lacks grooves, so it's extremely difficult to open and close (it requires rubber gloves, someone who's very strong, and has lotsa patience to wrestle with it every morning in order to finally twist it on and off).<br /><br />In addition, the Mr. Coffee brews faster than the Capresso espresso machine, finishing at the exact same time as the Capresso Milk Froth Pro! Ahhhhhhhhh. Perfect every time.

I purchased this unit to make flavored drinks and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the coffee and cappuccinos! The drinks are extremely hot, which is something that I like and look for in a machine. Many units that cost more do not make the frothed milk hot enough so the cappuccino comes out lukewarm. I have more expensive machines that do not produce much better espresso, once you get the grind size correct. The automated features and removable milk container make this unit a real winner. The fact that they sell the grinder along with the unit for under $150 is an amazing purchase. You will not be disappointed. The only drawback for the machine is the quality of the handle unit. It is quite light weight and made of plastic. If you are used to a heavier handle unit and knock box, you will break the handle on this unit. Just a tip, turn the handle upside down and tap the bottom with a heavy spoon or knife handle to knock out the grounds. This will preserve the handle.

Unfortunately it has developed some problems. The switch to turn it from pumping the espresso to stream does not always work. The switch has to be played get it the right position to work. Also, the machine will not make two espressos in quick succession. The light blinks quickly and the pump will not work. It generally takes turning off the machine and fiddling with the buttons and the on/off switch to get it to work again.

2241,1,"My husband and I had a Kuerig for a couple years. Prior to that, we weren't much coffee drinkers. We bought one of those plastic filters and filled it up with espresso in the mornings and we were perfectly content doing it this way and dealing with a technically crappy cup of coffee. Besides this, we also frequented Starbucks for their cappuccinos and lattes. I then decided to do some research on a new machine to surprise my husband for Christmas. I read every one of the reviews and decided to take the plunge on this one. On Christmas Day, my husband opened it up and set it up right away. He made our very first espresso using the same grounds from before and we were blown away. &#34;Is this how it's supposed to taste!?&#34;, we both exclaimed as we laughed about having dealt with crappy homemade coffee. &#34;Look, there's no black sludge at the bottom of the cup!&#34;, we also added. We are by no means baristas and had nothing else to compare it to, but this machine is night and day to that of a Keurig. I'll never go back to those dark times. Setup is pretty easy and doesn't take up a lot of counter space. While this is made out of plastic, it looks much more sophisticated than our old plastic Keurig and looks nice. So far, this machine has seen a lot of use since Christmas morning. We are going to start grounding our own beans to get the most out of it.<br /><br />My only issues are when using the frother, sprinkles fly from the cup onto the counter. Also, espresso continues to leak for a little while and we have used soy sauce plates to catch the leaks.

Yes, this is not as good as my home Breville BES920XL, but are you really going to take a $1200 machine to work and on travel.  My first Mr Coffee espresso machine lasted seven years of multi-daily use at the office (3 to 7x/day).  I purchased my second one while overseas in Southeast Asia and abused it for two years with calcium dense water.  My third one is in my sailboat and my fourth is in my office getting major abuse again.  This machine makes the coffee fun and produces excellent steam milk frothing even for the inexperienced.  To ensure long lasting use follow these rules:<br />1-don’t over tighten the portafilter.  Just tighten it enough to prevent a seal leak.  Avoid damaging the O-ring, it cannot be replaced.<br />2-never leave the portafilter locked in place when not in use.  Take it out immediately or the O-ring will be crushed and leak (I broke my 1st machine this way after leaving it in all the time for 7 years)<br />3-clean your coffee filters immediately<br />4-use low mineral water. I now use distilled water for consistent flavor and ability to judge various coffees without water flavor distortion.<br />5-never run the machine without water in the water tank.<br />6-remove the silicone steam wand tip to clean it well and to clean the steal steam wand.<br />Enjoy excellent coffees with minimal $$$ investment",5,2018-05-15,,True,,Excellent inexpensive espresso machine,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

2307,1,"I really wanted to like the Mr. Coffee ECMP50 machine, but am having a hard time warming up to it. I've used other pump-driven machines in the past; most recently a Lello 1375, which currently costs about 3X the ECMP50. After using the ECMP50 for a few days, I am somewhat sorry I didn't pay the additional money to buy another Lello 1375. Here's why.<br /><br />The Lello is much sturdier. It doesn't move around on the counter when you take the brew basket out. The build quality is noticeably higher throughout. Everything from the brew basket to the base unit itself is much heavier. The parts fit together more tightly, especially the brew basket and filter; it's really annoying the way the filter flops around in the brew basket for the ECMP50. You feel like it's just about to fall out every time you empty the grounds. The Lello unit lasted for years of daily use, and only required cleaning/descaling every few months. We'll see about the ECMP50 - although I don't know if I will stick with it for that long, as you might gather from what follows.<br /><br />The Lello holds more water so you don't have to refill as often, and it has a more powerful pump, so you get your coffee faster, and what's more important, it tastes much better. The ECMP50 seems to be very finicky about the grind, whereas the Lello was not. Too coarse, and you get watery coffee (poor extraction). Too fine, and you clog the filter. I've mixed and tamped using standard commercially ground coffee and still haven't got anything I really like. The readily available Starbucks grind doesn't seem quite fine enough. I'm going to experiment with re-grinding to make it finer, but that seems like a lot of work. UPDATE: If I regrind the standard Starbucks coffee, to get a fine powder (yes, kind of like &#34;salt&#34; in size), the end result is much better. Still not quite as good as a good drip machine, but much closer. I will keep trying!<br /><br />Finally, I like to make a cup of Americano coffee using a regular mug. The Lello had enough space for most mugs to fit under the brew basket, the ECMP50 is about 1/2&#34; shorter, and so few mugs will fit underneath.<br /><br />I will say the ECMP50 is quieter than the Lello, at least after the initial BRRRRR! you get when you first turn it on. It also holds onto the brew basket more reliably, so you don't feel like you have to have a hand on it during the entire brew cycle, just in case the handle disengages while the coffee is being made (the Lello tended to do that, but perhaps it was a function of not replacing the basket sealing ring more than every couple of years). One other good thing about the ECMP50 is that I expect you can get parts for it. The Lello has parts, but they are pretty expensive, and you must buy them through a New York distributor.<br /><br />Part II<br />Well, after trying all possible combinations, I managed to get a barely passable cup of coffee out of it. Not quite as good as a good drip machine, but almost. Basically, even if I filled the filter basket full of finely ground, fresh coffee, it still tasted weak. I thought I'd be able to do better, after all, I've been using pump espresso machines for over 20 years now. But I finally gave up! It was too much trouble to turn back in for a refund (I'd have to pay the shipping to return it, according to Jarden Industries, who sells these), so I gave it away. I hope the new owner has more success than I did. As a simple alternative, I got a used Keurig machine, bought a reusable filter basket, and added regular ground coffee to it. MUCH BETTER! So I'll stick with the Keurig, and if I get ambitious, I'll buy another Lello 1375, which is what I should have done in the first place.",1,2016-01-10,5.0,True,,"You get what you pay for, I guess ...","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

2324,1,"I bought this in July, 2017 (through my wife's account) for my office. I own a more traditional (better) machine at home and have been making my own lattes daily for the last 16 years. I haven't done any of the initial cleaning steps that others recommended other than washing everything with soap and water. I've made up to 4 lattes per day for myself and others with no issues for the last 6-8 weeks. The quality is not quite as good as my more traditional espresso machine at home, but you can't beat the convenience of this machine sitting on my desk. And really, the convenience is such that you won't care if it's not the best latte you've ever had in your life. The user interface to the machine is clearly well thought out with one glaring exception.<br /><br />My only complaint: You set the amount of foam using an imprecise knob on the front of the milk reservoir. It's a little difficult to dial in the exact amount of foam that you like, but with a little trial-and-error it can be done. That is, until you clean the milk wand which requires turning the same knob all the way around to point down to a &#34;clean&#34; setting. You clean it after each use, so you can never get the foam &#34;just right&#34; and simply leave it there. This is really a giant nitpick because otherwise the machine is a dream to own, but it seems like such a glaring design flaw only because the rest of the unit is so well thought out.<br /><br />Tip: clean the milk reservoir completely once a week (e.g. Friday afternoon before heading home) because the milk left in the reservoir will eventually go bad. I tend to keep topping up the reservoir during the week and storing it in the fridge except when in use. It's really difficult to clean the frother tubes once you've run curdled milk through them (but you _can_ do it).<br /><br />Recommended accessories:<br />- an iced tea spoon: the coffee dispenses after the milk and tends to sit in a layer between the foam and the milk. A quick two-swirl turn mixes the milk and coffee.<br />- a nice tamper: I bought the VonShelf one and not only does it work very well, it's quite attractive. https://www.amazon.com/VonShef-Premium-Barista-Coffee-Stainless/dp/B00OQ82KF0<br />- some type of narrow pipe-cleaner brush: I haven't found this yet, but you need it to properly clean the frother.",4,2017-08-23,4.0,,,Fantastic appliance with one glaring nit-picky design flaw,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

Deals like this are a valuable lesson in culinary name-brand bigotry.

Unfortunately, my husband and I were only able to make three proper espressos with this machine before it began spewing grounds and steam from the filter when we turned it on. We figured it was something we did wrong, so we made a few more, changing something each time (such as how hard we were tamping the grounds, adding more/less grounds, using different water, etc.) to no avail. Each progressive attempt resulted in more extremely hot grounds or steam being spewed out. Did some more research, and it turns out that this seems to be a problem with about 1 in 5 of these little guys. Honestly, save your money and buy a better machine.

I've owned my Mr. Coffee Expresso/Cappuccino Maker for nearly 3 months and love it - love it - love it! I was skeptical that a budget cappuccino maker could compete with the taste of a coffee-house and I have been pleasantly surprised. The machine has effective pump pressure and is easy to use and maintain. I really enjoy my morning coffee routine - it does take more attention to prepare than other methods but I feel luxurious savoring a cappuccino once or more a day! I haven't had to compromise taste or quality with a machine I can afford.<br /><br />Caveat - As some reviewers noted, there are some tricks to getting the quality of drink you want. Expect to experiment for a while before figuring out how to make the ""perfect cup"". Fresh beans are key; I now grind my own just before making the coffee. I've used different brands - so far, I like Starbucks fair trade Italian Roast the best. Fresh water - I use filtered water from our reverse osmosis system. Using a near full container of water seems to deliver better steam and pressure for both the coffee and milk (creating the ""puck"" - like grounds that are easier to dump). To get the strength of the coffee I want, I've experimented using the recommended scoop or slightly less and then tamping it down. The frother is also easy to use. I get the best results using 3-4 Tbsp. of 3% fat half and half. I've also used Silk's soy eggnog and soy pumpkin drinks for variety.<br /><br />Yum - think I'll go make another cup!",5,2014-01-11,,,,My new favorite kitchen toy!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

Originally, we had paid $50 for the Krups. Paying over $100 for a new machine seemed ridiculous, and this Mr. Coffee seemed like the best compromise, especially since we could use the glass carafe from the old machine if we would break the new one. Lo and behold, when it arrived, the construction is exactly the same as the Krups with a few minor improvements in the knobs, the shell, etc. The boiler cap is 1/16"" smaller in diameter, that's the only real difference. So we trust this machine will keep us in strong coffee and foamed milk for many more years.

I tried 4 expensive Italian espresso machines before I found this gem.

This machine makes a perfect espresso, cappuccino, or latte, almost instantly with no waste- best part is I can use as much of my favorite grinds or add flavors as I desire, for perfectly crafted custom beverages (I love using the Italian Torani syrups). I have had the machines for over a month now but make at least two drinks daily, and it never disappoints. The creama is always perfect, the espresso hot, and foam is superb.

2442,1,"By the time I bought this espresso maker, I had already gone through many different coffee and espresso machines. A friend raved about the Nespresso systems but I had used a Keurig for a few years and was done with the whole pod system, which seems wasteful and expensive, plus it was hard to keep it clean from icky sludge that formed in the water dispenser. Another friend raved about the Breville but the cost of that was way over my budget. This Mr. Coffee machine had great reviews and the price was good, so I decided to give it a try.<br />I've waited to write this review until I had some time to really get to know this machine and I can tell you I absolutely love it.<br />The Espresso, Cappucino, and Latte<br />Drinks I've made have all been delicious. The espresso comes out dark and rich and even has that crema top to it when the shots are finished pouring. There are two options: a single or a double filter and I always use the double. For milk, I use almond or rice milk and the froth on the cappuccino is great! The bubbles aren't as fine and &#34;creamy&#34; as you would get from a professional machine at an espresso bar, but the results are still delicious and impressive. The machine dispenses the milk first, then adds the shots of espresso, so I sometimes stir it after it's done to totally mix the espresso (especially if you add sweetener). There is definitely an advantage to using the right grind for the coffee beans. Be sure your beans are ground for espresso. I had used beans ground for pour over coffee and the espresso was watery.<br />The Machine<br />If you are looking for a brew-and-run system, this isn't your machine. But the time and effort you spend is honestly not that big of a deal and the results are worth it. Take a cappuccino, for instance. Here's the process. First, fill the water container with water and place on the back of the machine. Turn the machine on (it takes a few minutes to warm up). Next, fill the milk container with your type of milk, place the top on, be sure the setting is set to &#34;cappuccino&#34;* and insert the unit into the machine. Next, take the &#34;porta-filter&#34; and place a scoop of coffee into it, tamping down firmly with the tamper on the other end of the scoop. Insert the filter into the machine. Place a large cup under the filter (there's a pull out stand for a small cup but I rarely use that), make sure the silver tube (dispensing the milk) is pointed into the cup (yes, I've forgotten that and dispensed milk all over the counter by accident), and then press the cappuccino button twice (for a double). The machine goes to work, first dispensing the milk, then the espresso. You'll know it's working because it is loud.<br />After you've enjoyed your cappuccino, there are a few things you need to do to &#34;clean up&#34; and be sure the machine is ready for the next time. First, remove the porta-filter and dump the used grounds (they go into my counter-top food scraps bin). Rinse out the filter, and then place back on the machine and press the button for a single shot of espresso. This rinses out the espresso parts of the machine. I then remove the filter, take it apart under cool running water, and let it dry. For the milk container, turn the setting to &#34;clean,&#34; place a cup under the metal tube, and press the &#34;clean&#34; button (it's the latte button, pressed and held for a few seconds until the &#34;clean&#34; function turns on).  Now, the tube is clean and you can either place the container in the fridge (if there's milk left over) or rinse/wash and let it dry. Does this sound like a lot? It doesn't take long and it just becomes part of the process. Again, the results are worth it.<br />*As you can see from above, after you've cleaned the milk container, you have to turn the knob back to cappuccino or latte. If you forget, you'll quickly realize that you are dispensing steamed water instead of steamed milk into your cup (plus, the cleaning sound is different than the frothy milk sound).<br />Cleaning the inside of the machine is an easy process (using vinegar) and the machine seems to stay much cleaner than the Keurig machine I used to own.<br />Bottom line: So far, this machine has produced excellent results. Takes a bit of effort but the results are worth it.",5,2018-01-16,21.0,True,,The Results are Worth a Little Effort,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
2443,1,"Really sad about this purchase, I wanted it to work and before I purchased, I did my homework and read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance.  At first, I was really pleased, but within a month on making one cappuccino a day the froth started getting big bubbles and became watery.  I had been running the clean cycle after every use and went through the whole vinegar cleansing thing and it still was making substandard froth.<br />I contacted Mr. Coffee and they were great - sent out a new milk container w/ head and now a month has gone by and I am in the same boat again.<br />I'm going to return it and spend a little more $ to get a better machine.  Wish I had done that to begin with.",1,2017-03-08,46.0,True,,Really sad about this purchase,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
2444,1,"I bought this machine shortly before Christmas, so I've been using it for a number of months, now.  I love it!  I considered much more expensive machines, but didn't want to get locked into being required to buy certain 'pods' or 'k-cups.'  I also like mixing my coffees (half-caf, full caf, etc).  But most of all, I really enjoy MAKING my own cup of espresso or coffee.  I told my husband years ago not to buy me a push-button machine because I truly enjoy the process of creating my own drinks.  So, if you want to hit a button and have your espresso pop out, this is not the machine for you.  With this machine you turn the water on and off and, therefore, control the size/concentration of your drink. Next, the milk frother is great!  You are in full control of the frothing, as well. (I did remove the plastic/rubber sleeve the day I got it.)  I do use it with a thermometer and I have a blast attempting latte art (see pics).  What I can't do is 'free pour' art and I'm not sure if that's my lack of talent, the density of my espresso, or the density of my frothed milk.  There are tons of latte art videos on youtube, so you can certainly study up marvel at the talent out there! Finally, I made a fantastic iced coffee the other day.  I used the double-shot cup, and made about 5 or 6 oz, poured it over ice, added half-and-half and it was as good as any drink out there!  I buy beans at my fav, local coffee shop and have them grind them to the correct espresso grind. (This helps a little with the business they've lost after I bought my Mr. Coffee!)  Last run to the shop, however, I just bought beans and am now grinding my own with a Bullet.  There are videos on youtube demonstrating this exact machine, so check it out!

Without changing the amount of foam desired,  I could run a large and get a super small amount, or run a small and get a mug that was overflowing,  I used the machine on average once to twice a day following all directions for use and cleaning. The machine was never used to make multiple consecutive coffees.  Two weeks ago, the coffee became much hotter than it had always been, and clear extremely hot water dripped constantly whether the machine was on or off!

Soon afterwards the Coffee Pot who had mentored our young Mr.Coffee was replaced by a sexy new stainless steel one, who paid our Mr.Espresso no mind at all, and I suppose that was the final rejection in his young life, because soon after the sorry little sod wouldn't even heat up.

2523,1,"As a huge coffee fan, I have been seeking a way to make a good cappuccino at home since before Starbucks existed. The trick, of course, is frothing the milk, which can truly be done well only by those with training and practice. It's an art. I either have not been able to master using a traditional frothier correctly or I've never been able to afford a machine capable of creating a good froth. I've used external frothers with mixed results. Then I decided to investigate automatic cappuccino makers with self-contained frothers that dispensed the froth into the cup. I had my eye on a higher end one running about $500, but before investing so much, I wanted to at least look into the basic technology. I have to admit that I didn't expect much from a cappuccino maker from Mr. Coffee; one does not associate Joe DiMaggio with anything quite so continental. But I've been delightfully surprised. This little machine makes a very good cappuccinodfs that is fully automatic yet allows the amateur baristist to control every aspect of the process. I've had the machine for less than a week, but so far, I've developed a process wherein I wet the sides of my 12 oz. glass mug and coat the sides with a dusting of sugar. I then release about a half inch of froth into the mug, on top of which I suspend two shots of espresso. I then fill my mug with froth, which I swirl caramel atop. The machine would just as easily produce the entire cup automatically, but I like the white/black/white layering. The point is that I can let the machine do all the work, or I can experiment with something a little more artistic with equally good results. Not only that, but I can steam clean the frothing mechanism without pouring out the milk, after which I can place the milk-filled frother in the fridge overnight. For the first time ever, I can make and enjoy two or three large cappuccinoes every night without leaving the comfort of my. home. I couldn't be happier. I won't consider a more expensive machine until this one breaks down. It works beautifully, and I recommend it to any cappuccino lover.",5,2016-03-11,3.0,True,,Surprisingly Good,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

2549,1,"It did what it was suppose to do for about two months. For that I would give it probably 3 stars, because there was nothing extraordinary about this device.<br />Unfortunately contact power switch which is actuated by the plastic bump on the turning knob shaft stopped working. I suppose due to wearing out of the plastic actuator bump. The bump started missing it by a hair, and there was no way to bend blade of the contact switch to make it work again because the switch was not engaged by the movement of the blade of the actuating switch using its leverage but rather the bump was actuating the switch exactly and the blade was acting like just a spacer between the two. Poor engineering decisions about the location of the switch or the bad quality control in parts tolerances. By moving the contact switch about 1/8&#34; lower in its assembly would make it work more consistent, reliable and protect from fast wear out.<br />With the current design it is going to be a 'lemon' for unlucky customers.<br />One can fix it by shortening the switch and adding external electric switch. But why would you sign up for doing it? I got it at the beginning of May. And I see people complaining about the same symptoms. Once the switch becomes unreachable this device will not turn on.

Once I did that, it froths quite well.<br /><br />In the use of this older -- original?-- model, I replaced the broken carafe with a one-cup Pyrex measuring cup. Mine came with a stainless frothing pitcher, so it's too bad that has been left out of the new model.<br /><br />My routine is, start with just under one cup of water. When the brew reaches the 1/4 cup line on the pitcher, I switch to froth. When finished frothing, I return to the brew setting until the pumping is done and the machine quiets down. Then I turn it off and enjoy my large capucino. It's great, still cranking out the coffee daily since 1995. ALSO, my wife and I traveled in Italy a couple of years ago, and although the espresso and capucino we had there was superb, this machine comes very close. Finally, I removed the bottom of the machine just to see what was inside. The quality of what I could see was high. My only gripe is that the screw-on cap abraids the cast tank threads so that after many uses, you have metal shavings scattered on the top of the machine. This does not get into the machine, but it's a design problem.<br /><br />Thanks for the note about the line cord. Mine was too long so I wound it up and shortened it.

Haven't found a cup that works for the 15 oz latte setting. Taller cups are harder to get out from under the espresso filter. But taking the filter off first risks getting grounds in your coffee. We do hold the cup up a bit at the start of the milk frothing as it tends to splatter a bit (aimed straight at center of cup). Not a big deal.

Although It is not my first espresso machine, I would like to share some tips that will insure a longer life span for your new ECMP50:<br /><br />1)Always keep the machine clean. Clean the steaming tube at least once a week. circulate some fresh water in the coffee maker or use a lemon salt. If the steaming is too weak or0  too strong(unbalanced), unscrew the frothing tip and wash it .<br />2)Grind your own dark rousted coffee if you can, and make sure you press it hard into the coffee filter basket.<br />3) Always have enough water in the tank, or the  water pump will be gone before you know it. Make sure the water is above the minimum line at all times when the machine is in use.<br />4)Wipe the remaining milk foam from the rubber tube immediately after every use.<br />5)Detach the rubber steaming tube cover and wash it as frequent as possible to prevent bacteria.<br />6) Wipe the remaining coffee from the filter arm housing before every use.<br />7)listen to the machine.

After having to give a cuisinart the heave-ho, my wife picked this one up so I'd have something to generate caffiene.  The exterior is brittle plastic.  The tank cap often does not make a seal, requiring a revisit to the machine with a heavy cloth to try to coax it a bit tighter without incurring 2nd degree burns.  It's cheap. It works so far (if you overlook the seal problem).  It makes espresso, or a version thereof.  For a spare, or a temporary machine to get you by, this one is fine.  It's the flimsiest machine I've ever encountered.  If you're set on Mr. Coffee products, they make a pump machine that is much more solidly built, with a removable refillable tank.

2558,1,"I purchased this machine at Target about 2 years ago, hoping to find a less expensive alternative to coffee shops. I was dropping almost five bucks for a cup and figured it would be a good idea to look into getting my own machine. My top requirement was low price and this fit the bill. So far, I haven't had a single problem with the unit itself. I've managed to break the carafe (more like chipped it, a big chunk), but that was my own fault. I've had the milk steamer clog up on me, but to defuse this problem, I just unscrewed the bottom piece, soaked it in boiling water, and ran steam out of it for a bit (then screwed the bottom piece back on). My only complaint isn't even about the design, but know that this machine has quite a few pieces to clean each time you use it (which I believe is normal with espresso machines). It may take a while to get the hang of the milk steamer, so don't be discouraged if you purchase one.<br /><br />I'm a latte drinker and purchase Torani syrups for my home ""cafe."" (A local store sells the pumps too) I buy the coffee at my local health food store and use their grinder for espresso fine coffee (Organic, Fair Trade all the way. Same price as the regular.). I picked up a milk steaming mug for about $14 as well. My Raspberry Caramel soy latte comes out to under a dollar instead of five. I also don't have to drive to the coffee shop and stand in line anymore, it was worth the investment. It paid for itself in no time.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this machine. It works for me and for the price, you can't beat it. I look forward to my morning latte, it helps me get out of bed in the morning.<br /><br />Tip: To clean the milk steamer, the best way I've found is to boil water on the stove, pour it into a milk pitcher, and soak the steamer wand for about 10 seconds. If the water is hot enough, it should come off with little to no effort. You can start with room temp water and steam the water, but I feel it's more effort. I do this about once a week (I wipe it every time, but it still builds up). I've tried cleaning it with a cloth and steam like I've seen coffee shop employees do it, but I always burned myself.<br /><br />Tip #2: Make sure you're cleaning the machine with vinegar every 30-60 uses (soft water can go to about 60). Don't wait until there's a problem to clean it, otherwise you may get stuck with hot espresso and no working milk steamer. The only way I could get the espresso to come out was tip the machine, so I knew there was a problem. 2 cycles with vinegar and numerous water cycles later, it works again.<br /><br />Important: They're not kidding when they say to release the pressure before opening the top. Really. I've had 1st degree burns on my hand to prove it... more than once (even being careful, it happens).",5,2010-10-19,36.0,,,Great Product for a Great Price!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

2586,1,"So, as other reviewers have mentioned, it isnt something you can leave and go do other tasks, you kind of need to keep an eye on it, because it's pressurized, but that is what makes the coffee and the steamer so great. My 16 yr old is a little afraid of it, but I would bet that she'll warm up to it. It takes about 10 minutes to make a latte which is about what you'd spend in the drive=thru at you know where, and for less money. I had to play with it a little to figure out the steamer, you have to add extra water for the steamer to work and for 3/4 to 1/2 cup of milk, probably is a little longer than 60 seconds to get it nice and foamy. Also, I tried to skimp on the milk (calories) and that wasnt as tastey, so be sure and add at least around 3/4 cups for 2 cups of espresso. I fill up the reservior by adding the amount indicated on the steamer icon on the pitcher first, then put in enough for 2 cups. There is a trick to making froth...you have to be patient and keep swirling your cup around in a circular motion, you can hear a change in the steamer when it starts to really heat up and that's when you really need to keep it moving and keep an eye on the froth amounts. It does take a little getting used to, the steamer wand can get furious and overzelous if you have too much milk and not enough space for the bubbles/froth but worse case scenario, you have froth on your counter, and delicous froth on your hand, easy to clean, that's from having too short of a cup and too much milk. Anyways, got this on sale black friday and even if it's not a longer term solution, it's already saved us as much as I'd paid for it, so I give 4 stars.

It doesn't say that in the manual. Took me a while to figure that out. When I make a latte, i just turn the dial while it's frothing to make the perfect Latte.<br /><br />PRO TIP 2) If you grind your own beans, grind it finer than you would regular coffee bean.

I needed to read a little more carefully, I'm afraid, because every complaint I'm about to make has already been made.<br />  1)  It started out not working.  Turned it on, switched the knob, got zilch. Once more, nothing.  But then voila!, the third try was a charm.  I should have returned it, but it was Christmas day, and I was in denial about having to return it.  It continued to pump out espresso --until it didn't, 3 weeks later.  We called Amazon for a return as it had actually been purchased some time ago, though not given til Christmas.  They were great.<br />  2)  However, the truth is even when it made espresso, it was never hot--lukewarm at best.  The frother worked well though.  Better than the next machine we tried which is being returned today, a De'Longhi EC155.  (sigh) No froth?

2591,1,"I have tried a few espresso makers around this price range.  Initial review of this left me very pleased with the performance.  There were many things to like about this.<br /><br />1) large removable reservoir<br />2) hot flavorful espresso<br />3) heats quickly<br />4) top of unit conveniently holds espresso cups and tamper<br />5) removeable drip tray<br />6) accommodates larger cup than some other machines<br /><br />After about 11 months, some of those things had changed.<br /><br />1) took longer to heat<br />2) espresso produced was only warm<br />3) seal for the brew basket was not nearly as tight as it used to be<br />4) the dual blinking lights appeared<br /><br />The first time I saw the dual blinking lights, I experimented with system for a bit.  I cleaned it, I ran steam from the frother, let it run longer to get hotter and after a few minutes, it was working again.  I did not have anymore problems for another month or two.  Then the blinking lights returned, so I went through the same steps as I did last time.  I spent about 30 minutes trying to get this working again.  The steam would build up, but never pass water through the filter.  Eventually, steam would come through the brew basket seal.<br /><br />So mine lasted about 13 months.  I read many reviews looking for a different espresso machines and see that most in this price range up and a bit higher all seem to have various problems.  I ended up buying another one of these machines.  I bought this one again expecting it to not last much more than 1 year.  For the first year, while it was working, I was satisfied with the espresso it produced.  What I did differently this time was I purchased a 2-year extended warranty.  When this fails in a year, I can revisit the latest espresso models and see if there is a better choice at this price point.<br /><br />I give it 5-stars for initial quality and 1-star for overall reliability and product quality.

Mr. Coffee........ Who knew?<br /><br />Second update, Dec 2012  What can I say... this ting is the proverbial Timex... takes a licking, keeps on ticking.  It is chugging along, never missing a beat two years into owning it.  If it died tomorrow... it would be an easy decision, I can't afford a $400 to $700 machine like I dream of... being all automatic and washing my car too so without hesitation or even &#34;re-shopping/researching&#34; I would just go buy it again.  My best friend gave it a real nice compliment the other day... we went camping in the 5th wheel a while back so we took it along (what would &#34;camping&#34; be without espresso in the morning right?) and since then he has told me he cannot get his expensive one to produce as good tasting of espresso... using the exact same ingredients.  I use this almost every day... it is a winner, don't let the name fool you.  BTW, the goof balls that say it is too hard to empty are, well, how to say this... STUPID.  It comes with a black thumb lever on the handle of the grounds holder... you push it with your thumb when &#34;knocking out&#34; the grounds like ANY other style or brand.  Ironically... it is many brands that do not include this which makes it even easier than the rest.  If the knuckle heads that complained would RTFM first they would have enjoyed it and given it a better rating... whatever  :-)<br /><br />July 2011:  Was doing some other Amazon shopping... reading reviews like crazy... got done shopping and made a cup of espresso and figured I oughta update my review here since I use them so much.  The update is, see below.  This thing still rocks and it makes at LEAST one cup a day (takes a sip) and I would buy it again in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Nov 2010:  Like so many other reviews... this ain't my first Espresso machine rodeo.  When my last one, a cheapie, had died I started my usual online review endeavor (my wife thinks I am an excellent researcher/buyer... I think I might be obsessed) and looking at all the reviews I could find on machines under $200.00  Not to my surprise there was plenty to look at.<br /><br />A little background on me.  I am a lifelong coffee snob/junkie (50 years old started with espresso at 19) and a true fan of Peets coffee.  They have the best beans, coffee (of all types) and service in my not so humble opinion.<br /><br />I looked long and hard at many reviews and one thing that really bothered me was the poor reviews and reliability of so many of the $100 to $200 machines... almost seems like they are real cheap versions of the $1000.00 stuff and suffering from being to poorly built to meet the price range.  Just my theory but the reviews were all awful.  I was pretty bummed out about this because it was not looking good for finding what I was looking for and the bottom line to that was an easy, fast, reliable and especially great quality shot of espresso.  Maybe I was asking too much I started thinking.  I have no idea why I started looking in the lower prices... I think it was because I had looked at everything at the top of my price range so I had no other direction to go because I was set on my price limit.  Anyway... I came across the Mr. Coffee machine and especially this review<br /><br />[...]  by K. Krueger (THANKS!!!)<br /><br />So with great doubt about a brand that I thought epitomizes crap coffee... you know... the big tin cans full of the stuff they make at the office?  Well I started reading all of the reviews and was pretty surprised at what I was reading... almost all of them glowing, there are a few that are not but there always is, the main theme was clear, almost everyone was happy with it.  It is a pump and not steam driven, it has a large tank so refilling the water is rare (love it!) and...<br /><br />IT MAKES GREAT ESPRESSO?<br /><br />It is true, I went to Target (yuk, not normally ever seen there) since I could have it right then and there and have a local place to return if it was bogus, which I thought there would be a chance of.<br /><br />Brass tacks<br /><br />Heats up super fast to make coffee, you turn it on and it will be ready in about half the time it takes you to grind the beans.  The cup warmer will not be warming the cups in this time... that takes longer and if you want that, just turn it on sooner.<br /><br />As mentioned, the tank is large, easy to remove and fill and to reinstall in seconds.<br /><br />The steamer works fantastic... lot of high pressure steam... it foams FAST.  Nice that it swings out to the front for use (which I hardly do, I like mine straight) and then swings back out of the way... I forget it is there sometimes.<br /><br />The cup/coffee basket is easy to clean, fill, remove, insert... nothing to it, sweet and simple.  There is one beef I have with it, it is not as large as some espresso makers have so you will not be making a true quad shot with this... you could keep pumping until you had that quantity of coffee but you would be over using the bean.  If I want a quad, I have to make two batches, which is so fast and easy, frankly it is rarely an issue.<br /><br />The position of the basket is high so almost all of my traditional height coffee cups can be used... not tall coffee cups but definitely a restaurant size cup.<br />The cup warmer tray area is nice and works nicely with (estimating/guessing) 5 - 10 minutes of warm up but is not something I care about or use... I keep my coffee scoop and a few demitasse cups there.<br /><br />The coffee... ah yes, the actual product, is fantastic.  You have to personally observe the process and switch the pump off when it has produced enough espresso... I personally wait until the coffee coming out turns an approximate &#34;blonde&#34; and then switch off.  Sometimes I will switch off a little sooner depending on the strength I want.

If it died today, I would go buy another today.  I have been using it for about five months now... I have at LEAST one double shot a day then my wife has some too now and then.

2631,1,"I love this little espresso machine. For what it's worth, it's awesome. It brews delicious, foamy espresso really easily, and the milk frothing wand creates really nice, thick foam.<br /><br />I love espresso drinks, but had never tried to make one on my own before -- but I got this machine as a gift for Christmas, and I had it out of the box and brewing espresso in about 20 minutes! The instructions are really clear and detailed, so beginners like myself can pick up on it pretty quickly. I started making really tasty cappuccinos right away.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this thing 5 stars is that the milk frother -- though it creates really nice foam -- does not heat up the milk very well. I usually end up with a lot of foam, but lukewarm milk. I prime the steamer beforehand, and also have a metal frothing pitcher for this purpose, but still can't quite heat up the milk enough. Whether or not it is my technique, or the machine, I guess I can't say for sure.<br /><br />As for the other reviewers who said their machine leaked -- I haven't experienced that. But if you don't empty out the drip tray on the bottom, it will fill up with water really quickly from the steam, and I could see how that might overflow, so be careful with it.<br /><br />----------- UPDATE! ---------------<br /><br />After owning this for about 6 months, I'm upgrading my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars! This thing still works beautifully, and my roommate and I both use it every day. If you're on the edge about buying this -- do it. Seriously.<br /><br />I was able to overcome the problem I mentioned previously where the temperature of the milk was too cold -- I basically just have to completely submerge the milk frother for quite some time (30-60 seconds?), to heat up the milk, before bringing the tip of the frother back to the surface of the milk, to create the foam.<br /><br />Since I received this espresso machine, I've developed a taste for drinking strait espresso. Regular coffee is for pansies.<br /><br />I also frequently make iced lattes with different syrup flavors, and I hate going to coffee shops -- my own homemade espresso drinks are so much better because I can make them however I want, and they are obviously cheaper.<br /><br />Again, it does NOT leak, unless you never empty the drain tray. Make sure you empty the tray after every use, and rinse it out so that it doesn't get any gross build-up. Also, run the machine with just water every once and a while, to clean it out a bit. If you're using the milk frother, clean it immediately after every use, which will also prevent clogs.

2643,1,"After reading all the customer reviews on Amazon, I was a bit scared to even take this out of the box. Folks were using candy thermometers to check the water temp, using metal tampers to apply 30 lbs of pressure to the coffee grinds, insisting the beans must be ground at home, priming the unit a half dozen times before using it! I thought I might need degrees in chemistry and physics to make a cup of coffee.<br /><br />Instead, I took it out of the box, followed the manufacturer's simple priming instructions, and gave it a shot. I had just bought a pound each of good coffee ground for use in my drip pot before it broke, and couldn't just throw them out. So I bought some Starbucks espresso blend (ground) and mixed them all together. I used the tamper that was provided (plastic), and started trying out the various settings.<br /><br />The first cup was okay, though not quite strong enough for my taste. (This might be where doing that additional priming pre-use comes in.) The second cup was amazing. It is so easy to use. Turn it on, wait for it to warm up, and press a button. Play around with the different settings to get the frothiness to your taste, as well as the coffee:milk ratio. I go for more froth to start, because I can always add another shot of espresso in less than a minute. Cleaning is just as easy -- there's a setting to clean out the milk tube automatically.<br /><br />I've had the machine for less than a week, so I can't comment on its durability. But it sure is fun to make cappuccino now!<br /><br />My one complaint is that when I ordered it the stainless model wasn't available, and there was a $50 price differential between the white and the red.

2645,1,"This is a great little espresso maker except for the fact that the INSTRUCTIONS ARE WRONG RE THE AMOUNT OF WATER TO USE FOR 1 CUP OF CAPPUCCINO under How To Make Cappuccino. It's astounding that no one seems to have caught this and called Mr. Coffee Customer Service as I just now did (though a woman giving a demo of the machine on YouTube states that the instructions for the amount of water to use for 1 cup are CLEARLY WRONG without having notified Customer Service about it, but then proceeds to only add an oz. of water, thinking the 2 Cup mark is 2 oz. when it's actually 4 oz., and wonder why there's not enough steam to froth the milk). Customer Service amazingly said that after years of using the same wrong instructions that I'm the first person who ever contacted them about it (or did others call and they ignored it?) and essentially agreed that I was right and would document all that I said (including the YouTube woman who also said the amount of water was wrong). The &#34;2 oz.&#34; for 1 cup of cappuccino should be 6 oz. to brew the espresso, turn it OFF after it reaches the 2 Cup line in the carafe which is about 4 oz., put the Frothing Aid in a little milk pitcher and then turn the control knob to STEAM with 2 oz. of water left to froth/steam the milk and VOILA, cappuccino (or latte). When I saw the instructions said 2 oz. of water for 1 cup and about 10 oz. for 2 cups (which is about what it is to &#34;Fill to top of metal band of glass carafe&#34;) I immediately saw there was a problem with the 1 cup directions. How unbelievable that this has gone on for years with incorrect instructions! I see that a number of people on various sites have said the milk steamer doesn't work on their espresso maker and they would return it, with people telling them it probably didn't work because there wasn't any water left in the reservoir but almost no one seems to have caught the reason why there's no water left which is because the instructions are wrong and say to use much too little water (2 oz. when it should be about 6 oz.).

2648,1,"You have to consider the price of this machine (I paid $29.99) and how much it saves you from running out to the coffee shops for your coffee fix.  This little machine is great.  As sensible reviews note, you have to play with the amount of water and the kind of coffee (and grind) for you to get it how you like it.  Curiously enough, the machine does not know how you like it right out of the box.  Most importantly, you have to understand you get what you pay for.  They make professional-grade espresso machines that have more features and equipment, but they cost a professional-grade price.  I will share some things that I learned:<br /><br />I use an organic dark French roast I got at the local big warehouse store (and had a $1.50 hot dog and pop on my way out). I used their grinder on the way out. I set it to 4 (out of 10 with 10 being most coarse) and it has worked fine.<br /><br />I generally use the recommended settings--water level at 2 = coffee level at 2, water level at 4 = coffee level at 4.<br /><br />Yes, you should tamp the coffee.  Yes, you 'could' use the back of the rounded scoop.  Hilariously, I use the bottom of an unused K-cup (mine is a vanilla caramel that nobody wanted to drink, but you could use any flavor, I suppose).<br /><br />If I want to steam, I PUT IN A LITTLE EXTRA WATER.  You need water to make steam (#science).  If you brew your espresso, you won't have much water left over for the steamer.  Therefore, I steam my milk (when I decide to add this perk) BEFORE brewing the coffee.  After adding the water (and setting the coffee), turn the knob to steam and then wait.  After you steam to your caffeine-addicted heart's content, set the machine to brew and the coffee will brew immediately as the water is already hot. When I'm in a hurry in the morning, I'll just throw a mug with milk into the microwave. Still tastes good.<br /><br />When you are done, you need to turn the machine back over to steam to release built-up pressure, which makes taking the water lid off easier. You'll find that hours later, there is still pressure in the machine. If you do it immediately after, put a mug under the steamer because some will come out.<br /><br />I use this once or twice a day, and it is great.  Dollar for dollar, you aren't going to find anything better.  Just be realistic about what you are getting.  You want a frothing pitcher and a tamper?  You can find machines that do that, but they cost more. Some people look for everything to complain about.  Would you buy a Ford Focus and then complain about it's lack of towing power?  I didn't think so.

Unfortunately, the third Mr Espresso had the nauseating plasticky smell coming from the lid, that many others have written about here. No matter how many times I washed and soaked it, or how long I aired it, the smell wouldn't go away and would seep into the coffee, which would obviously ruin the experience altogether - not to mention that it can't possibly be healthy!

The improvement in richness and flavor from my old steam machines was like night and day, showing through nicely even in a cafe mocha.  The machine is also less fiddly than the steam machines I've owned and not hard to use at all.<br /><br />My complaints about this machine are all pretty minor.  The machine will sometimes leak under the drip tray.  This usually means there is some foreign object like a coffee ground preventing the drip tray from seating precisely in the purge port and is easily enough remedied or cleaned up.  The mode buttons are not particularly sensitive to quick presses and need to be pressed a bit longer than expected.  The steam function will automatically stop after a few minutes, just long enough to get 16 oz. of milk hot.  I then have to act fast to keep milk from backwashing into the steam tube and causing more cleaning effort.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's no Saeco Via Venezia, but it's close.

It takes a few tries to learn how much water you'll need to froth your milk after you brew enough for your latte, but the morning routine now is fun, the coffee smells great too. Tell you Starbucks ain't that good anymore. One thing is that if you're looking for espresso only, the brewed coffee isn't very hot: drip flow into cold glassware. I learned to enjoy a great latte:<br />- Using a good ground gourmet blend, I measure about half the marked amount for one cup (too strong otherwise).<br />- Press the coffee ground down, otherwise the steam will make a bit of a mess over the cup. I use a simple flat bottom measuring spoon for this.<br />- Pour two cups of water from the glass pot into the boiler, seal the lid shut<br />- Brew about one cup, turn off<br />- Fill frothing pitcher halfway up (pitcher not included, purchased separately)<br />- Froth milk to top of pitcher<br />- Pour coffee and milk on cup<br /><br />Plusses<br />Can't beat coffee quality for this price, steamer wand, simple & compact, fun!<br /><br />Could be better<br />Frothed milk isn't thick enough for art, no quick pressure purge valve (takes a minute or two sometimes), maker doesn't heat glass pot, so it's difficult to make hot espresso.<br /><br />Overall wonderful value!",5,2013-11-03,,,,Works great!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

I knew it was cheap but it was the only one they had and I figured it doesn't take much to pull a shot of espresso.<br /><br />This isn't an espresso machine, this is a miniature drip coffee machine made to look more complicated. I've never seen shots of espresso pulled the way this machine pulls them. A shot of espresso should steadily pour, making three layers in the shot. This machine brews a cup of coffee, but periodically stops to sput out a random foam meant to be the crema apparently. In a normal shot the crema appears naturally.<br /><br />The steam wand does not create the ideal fine foam you want to see in a latte/cappuccino. It has holes at the top of the wand meant to create the foam but it just bubbles it making the foam large and frothy. Which is exactly what you want to avoid. It is very weak also, I followed the instructions the first time I used it and I was left with a glass of cold milk. Also the wand doesn't move which makes it very hard to steam the milk.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a mini coffee machine that takes twice the work to brew in, worth every penny.

So as an experiment I wrapped a few layers of electrical tape tightly around the nozzle to essentially make it thicker in diameter to create a tighter seal.  And it worked !<br /><br />I left it that way for about 30 minutes without a leak, confirming my theory that either the gasket is too wide or the nozzle too narrow.  However, after about 45 minutes I could see water starting to seep out from the bottom, and notice wet tape was starting to unravel.<br /><br />I did also notice that the nozzle itself on the bottom of the reservoir is tapered ever so slightly, but probably just enough to undermine the gasket's seal.

It randomly overheated and exploded as I was removing he brew handle with the coffee grounds in it. The grounds basket went flying across the room! I was so lucky it didn't hit me in the stomach. If I had just been a couple of inches to the left, it would have nailed me. The explosion was so bad that it even expelled an interior rubber ring that fits on the inside of the area where the brew basket makes contact. It was rather scary.<br /><br />I think I am done with these machines now. None of them seem to work properly.",2,2018-02-21,,,,Exploded as I was using it.,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
2708,1,"This little machine is awesome! And all these reviews complaining about the milk frother breaking & not working anymore, it's NOT the milk frother itself that is breaking. I noticed 1 day after hand washing my milk reservoir top, where the round tubular connector piece slides straight into the frother port coming from the actual machine itself. There,+ on the black top part of the reservoir, on the outside, in the back right corner (if ur looking at it from the front) there is a little hole coming out of the back & if u look inside that little hole, there is a very tiny little black plastic looking screw thats very fragile.. One time, while I was cleaning the milk residue out of that little hole, I realized that a tiny little black plastic piece had broken off while i was cleaning it. And i couldn't fix it or glue it back so I tried to go ahead & run my frother & it wouldn't do anything but spit very little, plain liquid out that had zero froth. Turns out, that little insignificant screw was VERY IMPORTANT! Its the part that actually froths the milk! Without it, the entire milk frother was totally useless.. After that, I figured I had just ruined a $200 machine that I had less than 3wks & was fixing to toss it out when I realized that I could just buy a new entire frother assembly or even just the top part itself for around $6. They were having a sale on all their extra parts for my barista, so I just went ahead & bought all new back up parts just in case I ever needed them.. I put the new milk reservoir into my machine, and it works like brand new!<br /><br />So I wanted to let everyone know that you don't have to settle on just using your expresso side of your machine & do without your frother.. Because, with this piece being so tiny, I guarantee that if you had actually lost it, you would most likely not have a clue that you did. And every review I've read stating that their frother broke on them, sounds identical to what happened to mine. Its so simple to FIX!<br /><br />But, other than t",5,2015-11-28,2.0,,,This little machine is awesome!

2710,1,"We received this in June of 2010 as a bridal shower gift. While my husband and I enjoy coffee and cappuccino, we had never owned an espresso maker before. Without reading the directions, it took me a few times to understand how the handle locked the cup of espresso grounds in place, but my hubby quickly figured it out for me. I love, love, love that this machine also steams milk! Something worth noting is that you have to have a good amount of water in the reservoir tank or the steamer will not work appropriately. I did not know this at first, but it only makes sense. Also, you need to turn the machine on, select your mode (brew or steam) and then wait for the light to turn solid red before you can turn the knob to start either process. After steaming or brewing our machine makes a little ""decompressing noise"" but I feel that is perfectly normal. Another thing to note though is that you need to keep the overflow tray attached at the bottom because the machine is eliminating water when it decompresses and this is where it goes. Overall we are extremely happy with this machine and we would recommend it to anyone. I love the design, the look and the overall quality of the machine. One more thing - be sure to use the ""wrench"" that is built into the coffee scooper to take off the bolt at the end of the steamer tube so that you can properly clean it out. This will keep things running smoothly and it only takes a couple of minutes to do. Just be forewarned that the bolt will be hot!",5,2011-09-13,3.0,,,Great home espresso maker!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
2711,1,"If I could give this less than one star, I would. Let me start of by saying, I was a barista for a few years and know how to pull a good shot, steam milk with good foam, etc etc. Since I have since moved on with my career and am no longer a barista I decided getting a home espresso machine would be great to satisfy my craving for delicious espresso drinks without spending $6 at a coffee shop. I was very impressed with my first few drinks, even though the plastic feel of the entire machine bothered me. This is a very straight-forward machine and perfect for beginners. The glass carafe has line guides to show you where to fill the water to and steaming milk and pulling shots is pretty simple. Keep in mind you will need to tamp the espresso so without a tamp, you will have to buy one. I used my stainless steel coffee scoop and while annoyed, it did get the job done if you didn't get a tamper right away. Anyways, my excitement quickly turned to frustration. The machine stopped pulling shots and instead began to sputter water and would stop when there was still water in the chamber. I did everything I knew how to do, asked a friend who has the same machine and called Mr Coffee. In fact after a few days of trying to fix it, the machine stopped pulling shots completely and would expel bubbles from the portafilter. I came to the conclusion that it was a combination of me making multiple drinks a day (although a drink for myself and my husband shouldn't be too much to ask for from a machine, even at this price point) and the cheap build quality. If you are a college student or single or anything of the sort and just want to be able to make a drink on occasion, I suppose you could get away with purchasing this machine. I ended up returning the machine and getting a Saeco pump driven Via Venezia espresso machine, while much more pricy at $300-400 (depending on where you buy it) it makes 2-3 drinks a day without hesitation and is a wonderful little work horse.",1,2014-09-08,6.0,,,Only lasted a week!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

As most reviews state the machine has issues frothing milk after a while. Regular cleaning as mentioned in the manual are necessary, but every few wks you should unscrew the top of the milk frother, take it completely apart, and soak it in vinegar. The steamed milk creates a slime and clogs the frother. Very similar to sippy cups it can mold and make you sick. I mean it's milk of course it's going to get gross sitting around.

I'll explain more later because we did get a replacement.<br /><br />I'm a barista but I'm also not a picky person. However, this is the worst tasting &#34;espresso&#34; shot I've ever tasted even though we had fresh espresso beans and bought our own tamper. It's fine if you want to use it in a flavored latte, where you wont taste the espresso. Personally, I just want to take a espresso shot in those sluggish mornings to help get up, when coffee isn't doing it. The espresso shot is very bitter and tasted old. The steam wand works fine, it works good for cappuccinos. I only use the wand now to make hot chocolates, because i like the milk foam. The product is pretty scary in general. The pressure that builds up makes this noise and I'm afraid it's going to explode (again), taking off the cap you can hear the pressure being released even if you wait a day to unscrew it. Sometimes the cap will pop off in your face, one time it hit my eye. I do not use this product unless I want steamed milk foam, even then I use it with caution. Any weird noise and I back away from the product.<br /><br />EXPLOSION WARNING<br />The reason I gave this 2 stars and not one star is because of the costumer service.<br />The glass coffee pot exploded with glass flying everywhere. I wasn't too far from the unit with my back turned, glass flying everywhere. My entire family was in the room. Luckily no one was seriously injured, my mother suffered a scratch from the glass on her eye. I posted it on facebook, and tagged Mr coffee in the picture.

In less than two minutes (probably less than 1 minute, although I haven't timed it) you'll have your drink.<br /><br />The only suggestion that would make it better would be to have a few lines printed on the milk container, so you have an idea of how much milk to pour for the drink you're making.<br /><br />EDIT: We've had this appliance for over a year now, and it is still one of our favorites.

I noticed that some reviewers mentioned that the steamer didn't work well over time.  The key is to keep it clean, so I clean it after every use - takes 30 seconds and done.  Perfect coffee every time.  In addition, I was using half and half, and now with the steamer I can use skim milk with just a &#34;touch&#34; of half and half, so I've cut down on calories and fat and cannot tell a difference.

The coffee grounds exploded out of the filter all over the counter along with half the carafe of coffee that should have gone into the carafe.  Will be calling Mr.Coffee again tomorrow with my disappointment of their product.  I don't want this replaced with the same piece of garbage.  Considering the number of similar complaints on here, I'm about ready to get a completely different brand product.  Their customer service is good (based on them responding so quickly to my first issue) but they need to recall this before someone is seriously injured.  DO NOT BUY!  If you can get the older model (ECM250) I highly recommend it over this one.  Those of you having no problems, perhaps you have the ones that are not lemons.

2826,1,"I've only had this little guy a couple days and I am already in love. I am an avid coffee drinking, and have been drooling over machines that cost hundreds for years. Always wanting something big and fancy. Having worked at Panera for a year as a Baristo (Male version of a Barista) I had a decent idea of how to make a few drinks.  I moved out of my parents house and now I'm buying all the small appliances I can fit in my humble abode. One of my very well off older coworkers recommended this to me as I was spending somewhere around $100+ a month at starbucks. He bought the same one and said it pays for itself. After using this, I can tell you the espresso is fantastic, I am a little miffed it didn't come with a steam cup or a tamper, but for $40 I am not complaining. You absolutely have to clean after every use, no questions about it. If you don't, this thing won't last, nothing will. Also, after a while it's probably good to run some coffee machine cleaner through it or something like that.<br /><br />I am super impressed by the power of the steam. I like to brew my espresso first. I put in a little over 4 cups of water,til the water level touches the metal in the top. After my espresso has almost reached level 4 in the pot I quickly switch to steam, the extra water should be enough to get your milk going and make a great little cup.<br />Also, it's super impressive when you can bring a potential mate over and make fancy coffee drinks, they don't have to know you bought the cheapest espresso maker available, and this little guy would never give that impression either. I look forward to many many years of coffee from this machine, and might just  by a 2nd in preparation as I know that prices will only be higher years down the road.",5,2015-03-10,,,,Best espresso machine for the money - Buy a steam cup and tamper,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
2827,1,Let me say that as of one month of everyday use I am keeping this coffee maker. I had serious reservations when I first started using it. In my opinion the machine has a serious design flaw in the way the water tank sits on the base.<br />What happened to me was after several uses I noticed that the water tank was leaking water on the counter. I have wood floors in my kitchen and this looked like a deal breaker for me.<br />I decided to troubleshoot the problem and my first step was to call Mr. Coffee support. Of course the rep I spoke with said they never heard of this problem and to send the unit back. No surprise there.<br />I checked to see that the silicone gasket in the base was not damaged. Check<br />The valve in the bottom of the water tank was working properly. Check<br />I then happened to press lightly on the side of the water tank after resetting it into the base. I could see water starting to leak between the tank and the base. Sure enough it continued to leak on to the counter. I then pressed lightly in the opposite direction and the leak stopped.<br />I was able to duplicate this leak on a consistent basis.<br />So long story short this unit has a design flaw that can create a leak if the tank is moved out of position.<br />I am sure this can happen by how the unit is handled when moving it or repositioning it on a countertop.<br />I have continued to use the unit because it does make a great cup of coffee and the milk frother is a great feature. So if the unit does not break down I will be careful with the water tank.

2829,1,"I have had this for over a year and am really satisfied. Sure, it's not a &#34;real&#34; espresso maker, but it does the job fine and is fast. It really doesn't take longer than to brew a pot of coffee -- probably less time. I was looking for something that was simple to operate and made espresso and lattes that taste good. Prior machines I had made awful espresso, broke, or were difficult to operate. I love the water reservoir, which means I'm not constantly pulling the machine out from under the kitchen cabinets to add water. This is a time saver. It comes with two espresso filters -- single and double. It's easy to make espresso without foam and foam without any coffee drink. The buttons are easy to use and straightforward. It's safe -- you aren't going to get a shot of steam or milk splatter in your face. What I like best is that you don't have watch over it and babysit it. It's all automated, though you can also customize the amount of foam. It's easy to clean by hand or in the dishwasher. The only drawback is that although the foam is supposedly customizable, it doesn't get quite to the quality of what you'd get at a coffee shop.",5,2015-05-31,,,,... had this for over a year and am really satisfied.

2830,1,"First of all, what does it take to make a good espresso? The most important thing are the beans you use. It doesn't matter what kind of machine you have, blah beans = blah espresso.<br /><br />I was using a push button machine for about six months until it broke. At first I was considering replacing it with a Nespresso machine, but thankfully I came to my senses and got this at my local Wal-Mart. I'm very glad I ditched the world of automatic machines. This just take a little bit of effort, but with a little practice you don't even notice it.<br /><br />A note about the steam wand / Frother: There is nothing wrong with it. Making a good froth just take a little practice. The results can be inconsistent sometimes but that has everything to do with the technique, not the frother.<br /><br />Make sure you have plenty of steam. I usually make two shots, so I fill up the carafe to the 2 shot mark, then fill it up more (about half way to the 4 shot mark). When brewing I wait for the espresso to reach the 2 shot mark then stop the brewing and begin frothing immediately.This ensures that you have plenty extra steam left over to froth/steam the milk.<br /><br />Use a thermometer when frothing/steaming: Mine cost about $5. You froth the milk until it gets to 120 degrees, then steam it to 140.<br /><br />A frothing pitcher helps, but isn't necessary: I'm just using another coffee cup to froth right now, the result would be better with a frothing pitcher, but I still don't have any problems getting a good froth.<br /><br />You don't just stick the steam wand in the milk and magically get a good froth. You want to tip of the wand to be just under the surface of the milk to froth. As the milk heats up the level will rise, adjust the position of the wand as needed. There is a certain sound that is made when it is properly frothing, it's a small gurgling/suction sound. If you hear a loud bubbling sound it isn't in far enough, just a tad deeper will get you there. If you don't hear much of anything it is in too far. You will know it when you hear it. Keep that sound going until the milk reaches 120, then stick the wand all the way in to steam to 140.<br /><br />Once you are done frothing don't forget to depressurize the remaining steam. This is most easily done buy going back to the brew mode. Make sure you have already emptied the carafe before depressurizing.<br /><br />Finally, any espresso machine, regardless of price needs to be descaled periodically, don't forget it.",5,2014-06-01,2.0,,,Great espresso on a budget,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
2831,1,"Having taught eBay classes for about 10 years and even writing an electronic book on the subject, I am addicted to cruising thrift stores. That's where I found a virtually unused unit with accessories for $6.50.Had somebody donated a dead unit to get a tax credit or with the mistaken idea that &#34;maybe somebody can fix it.&#34; [You can't].<br /><br />With dual lights flashing and no apparent water leaving the generous water tank, I thought it was clogged or the pump was no good.  But then I remembered to PRIME THE PUMP. I did this by switching over to the steamer and letting it chug until some water came out. Then I switched back to espresso and pumped out some water.  Presto!  Problem solved.  I wonder if some folks here have forgotten to do that when no water comes out?<br /><br />Cheapos are getting better than a few years ago. This (Chinese) maker is ready to dispense a shot in very, very short order.<br /><br />Like the &#34;better&#34; machines, this unit sends a pre-brew squirt of water before the main flow begins. The taste is about the same, and my only complaint is that the &#34;push the button and then turn the dial&#34; is a bit odd. Probably a way to keep costs down, less complex.<br /><br />Obviously Mr. Coffee's holding company is not in the business of stocking parts or making repairs, but this is more common everywhere now that these devices are all from China.  It is cheaper to send you another one than paying some tech a large hourly wage to swap out a gasket.<br /><br />The alleged complaints that some have been told the units are out of warranty at the time of purchase because they are &#34;new old stock&#34; is intolerable.  What they are really saying is that they have moved on to another model or found another supplier and have no replacements. That is THEIR problem, not yours! People experiencing such a dodge should contact their elected representative so they can contact the FTC.  Trust me, it works!<br /><br />Regarding leaks, I strongly suspect that many never read the instructions or did not keep track of how many drips finally filled the holding area below the metal shelf.

2839,1,"IMPORTANT TWO YEAR UPDATE!!!! PLEASE READ!!!! YOUR MACHINE MAY NOT HAVE DIED!!!!! I DID THIS &FIXED IT!!!! CHECK YOUR INTERNAL FILTER! THIS IS NOT IN THE MANUAL! See Below! (Original One Year Review Follows, so skip this if you just want a review, but read it if you plan on buying it because it might save you a few years down the road!) It is a good machine for the price!<br /><br />I noticed into the second year that we started having problems with the coffee forming muddy sludge and not being able to tamp it the same as we used to. The espresso wasn't as strong and we thought it was Starbucks grinding the espresso differently. We prefer Illy Brand or other brands, but Starbucks is close and can grind it fresh wo buying a burr grinder. Not my favorite, but does the job for everyday espresso. The machine would stop brewing and we would have to take out the filter & basket, clean it out and replace with new espresso very loosely in the basket. Not very happy about that because it wasn't as strong and was wasting A LOT of espresso! Finally this morning it completely stopped working when I went to get my morning espresso!!!! OH NO!!!!! I tried cleaning it again internally with white vinegar, flushing it with water, but only the steam wand worked and water would only come out if the filter & basket weren't attached. Sadly I thought the seal had died and that was why it would build enough pressure to even allow water to run through the empty filter. I read the manual and there were no. answers. I checked on Amazon and saw sadly that many had theirs die around 2 or 3 years and happily replaced it. I got mine one HUGE sale around Black Friday and really didn't want to wait until next month. I honestly didn't want a new one. SO I went back a few hours later and took a good look at it, deciding it was no longer under warranty and only useful as a milk frother so WHY NOT TAKE A LOOK! DO THIS PART AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!! IT WORKED THOUGH! Take off the catch pan, water reservoir and unplug the machine and turn upside down to empty internal water over the sink. DO NOT PUT IN SINK!!!! Put down upside down on the counter on a towel. You will see in the middle of where you attach the filter and brew basket to the machine a BIG BLACK SCREW! Carefully unscrew the screw, as it's plastic and can strip easily. carefully take it off and be aware there's a spring directly under it that you MUST NOT LOSE! Now you've reached the round, silver INTERNAL FILTER! It is FACE DOWN with the bottom facing towards you (it looks just like the bottom of you filter baskets.) Carefully take it off and look at the side that was facing the machine (when you take it off and flip it over it will be slightly concave-this means you are looking at the top face of the filter.) THIS WAS MY PROBLEM!!!!!! MY INTERNAL FILTER WAS COMPLETELY CLOGGED ON THE TOP FACE (machine side) with espresso grounds forced backwards into it over time and there is NO WAY for them to come out when you clean it regularly as per the manual!!!!! I washed the internal filter and it cleaned easily. I also wiped out the inside with a damp towel gently until clean. I dried everything, replaced the filter front face down, put the screw in with the spring on the end and screwed it back in place. I flipped it over, put everything back together, filled the reservoir and plugged it in. Poof! I started it up and attached the empty filter with the basket and it WORKED!!!!! I ran about 16 shots worth of water through it until no residual grounds came out.Then I filled my double shot with the last of my espresso and attached it and WOW!!!! It was back to new!!!! It EVEN SMELLED like it did when brand new! I had forgotten over time! It had never lost the crema, but the crema was even better and the espresso darker and stronger like in the 1st year!!!! Now I wonder how many people threw theirs out after two or three years because this internal filter gets clogged and there's no instructions how to clean it. Knock on Wood! I hope mine keeps going for much, much longer and I hope I've helped many others save their machine!!!!! Cheers! It REALLY is a good little machine for the price! I grew up and owned the professional ones and WAY more expensive home ones and no, it's not that level, but it's still good espresso. Buy the expensive machines if you want excellent perfection. Read the review below. I still stand by it. :)<br /><br />I bought this machine last year at the beginning of the holiday season as an early Yule/Christmas gift for my whole family. We're still amazed how well it works a year later after daily use (often multiple times a day.)<br />It comes with both single and double shot filters, but I'd prefer if it came with two double shot filters as we never use the single shot. I suggest hand washing the filters. It only takes a second.<br /><br />It comes with a plastic scoop with a plastic tamper on the other end. The scoop is fine, but buy yourself a stainless steel tamper as the plastic is the wrong weight and does not pack the shot properly (too loose.) There was a very reasonable double ended tamper I bought on here that works perfectly.<br /><br />I love that the tray is removeable! It not only makes cleaning easier, but if you want to make it in a mug instead of a demitasse cup for maximum room for foam and you don't want to disturb the crema, remove the tray and just keep a kitchen towel right there for the small amount of water that comes out. After quickly wiping, slide the tray back in!<br /><br />The wand moves back and forth which is super convenient. After steaming milk (I prefer steaming half and half...super rich foam...but trickier to make) put the wand into a glass of clean water and quickly blow some steam through to clear the steaming wand of milk. Cleaning the wand while still warm is much easier.<br /><br />All in all, thrilled that we bought this espresso machine! It was $65, but it went on sale right after I ordered and Amazon adjusted the price! I definitely can't complain about  $45!!! Even better, Amazon conveniently carries the brands of flavored syrups (we love peppermint regular and sugar free), chocolate and some really great espresso from Italy, although we do get our daily espresso freshly ground at a local establishment for less.<br /><br />Mr. Coffee don't ever stop making this machine! I even put it back in the box and brought it on our yearly trip to our cabin. Lol, of course that's only possible if you're driving. :) Definitely worth it to have my espresso!!!<br /><br />And we named him &#34;George&#34; :)",5,2016-11-05,2.0,True,,Fantastic after a year!

2880,1,"This kind of espresso machine is great for the price. It does a great job of steaming milk and you get a reasonable crema on the coffee if you use the right roast and grind (espresso). If you live where there is hard water you may need to occasionally run some vinegar through the machine to dissolve the scaling inside which can block the steam. We have owned 4 or 5 of this style machine over the past 20+ years using them daily. The design flaw is the knob that switches from steam to brew. Eventually (2-3 years) the knob will either freeze up or break off. We have tried several different brands and the result is the same which leaves me to believe the mechanism is made the same way, possibly in the same factory.

2883,1,"This is my first espresso machine. I make two to three cappuccinos a day. It's easy to use. The pump has plenty of pressure, and it heats up fast. I removed the rubber nozzle from the steam wand immediately. I learned to froth without fancy gadgets, and it's a skill you'll be proud of if you do it that way.  Steam pressure seems good, and the espresso comes out in two golden heavy streams of froth, gradually condensing into a rich, dark liquid with good crema. I use Brazil Santos coffee, and it makes superb espresso. I have used it every day for three months with no problems so far. I got it on sale for $69.99, and I figure even if it only lasts a year, I got my money's worth of espresso. It's fairly easy to clean, and comes with everything you need to start making espresso right away. A few tips; do not grind the coffee too fine or tamp it too hard--this can make steam pop out of the gasket between the portafilter and the group. Grind and tamp require a little experimentation and practice, but it's not that hard. Also, as with any machine, don't store the portafilter on the group, or the gasket will compress and the seal will not be effective. So far, no negatives to report. I'll update this review if anything changes.<br /><br />Update:  May 2009. I have used this machine virtually every day (I say virtually every day because I use a Breville on the weekend). I make 2-3 cappuccinos a day with it. I have yet to experience any problems with it. I've decalcified it once in the last eight or so months I've used it, but only as maintenance. Easy to use, easy to clean. Water temp could be higher, but for an entry level machine, I'm still happy with it. Pump is still strong, steam is still very good. I would recommend this machine to anyone who wants to try making home espresso, but doesn't want to make a large investment in case they don't find it to their liking.<br /><br />Update:  March 2010.  Still going strong! I trade every week between this machine and a Breville. The Breville<br /> makes better espresso, but this machine makes better steam and is still easier to use. I still consider it just<br />an entry-level basic machine, but it's earned my respect. I've decalcified it several times in the last year, and the steam and water output is still strong. Honestly, even if it took a dump at this point, I would replace it with another one just like it. If you want to try making your own espresso, I doubt you'll find a more user friendly machine.<br /><br />Update: December 2010.  This machine functions the same way it did the first time I used it. Steam and water output is still strong. Yes it has some annoyances as others have pointed out. The drip tray is small and it leaks a little on the counter. I guess if someone really wanted a Gaggia or Saeco and bought this, it would be pretty disappointing. For me, however, this is my feel-good machine. It doesn't owe me a cent. I've probably made $5000 dollars worth of espresso drinks with this machine. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn't require a lot of maintenance. I guess this is my final word on this unit.

I make a latte/cappuccino for my wife and myself almost every morning and sometimes at night as well. The steam wand works great once you get the simple procedure dialed in. The espresso comes out great every time. This has been one of the best investments because before we bought this unit we made a stop at Starbucks quite often and that get pricey. And now that we figured out you can purchase the flavors from Starbucks, such as vanilla, I can make a latte that taste almost exactly like the latte we used to get at Starbucks.<br /><br />I had trouble at first figuring out a good procedure to fallow so for those who are interested,<br />Procedure I use to make Latte/Cappuccino:<br />1. Fill reservoir with 4 cup water. (I use store bought drinking water)<br />2. Fill 2 large coffee cups with about 1/3 cold milk and 4 pumps Starbucks vanilla flavor. (Starbucks vanilla flavor purchased from Starbucks)<br />3. Fill espresso filter to top and tamp down to about 2 cups. (purchase a decent tamper because the scoop does not work great for tamping)<br />4. Put espresso filter and carafe into position for brewing.<br />5. Plug Mr. Coffee unit in and turn dial to steam. (Good idea to put an empty cup under steam wand tip to catch and dripping water while steam gets up to temp)<br />6. Wait to see that the steam comes out of the wand without dripping water. (looking for a ""dry"" constant steam)<br />7. Turn steam off<br />8. Holding the coffee cup containing your milk, insert the seam wand into the milk and turn steam back on full.<br />(while steaming milk I like to move the wand in and out of the cup, don't take wand out of milk, until the froth reaches the top of the cup, almost overflowing the cup. Try not to create bubbles as much as you can. It's a little unavoidable at first. After froth reaches desired level I'll put the wand deep into the cup to get the temperature of the milk up. Hot to the touch.)<br />9. Repeat step 8 for second cup.<br />10. Turn Mr. Coffee dial to brew and brew two cups of espresso.<br />11. Pour espresso into coffee cups with frothed milk, stir mixture with spoon, then serve.<br /><br />Make sure to clean your machine after every use!

I read a bunch of reviews but there really wasn't anything like this in this price range.  There was just no way we were going to spend $200+.<br /><br />We absolutely love this machine (5 days in).  Did not buy from Amazon but from local Bed Bath & Beyond due to the 20% off coupon.  Love that we don't have to stand there while the milk is being frothed. We pick the double or single, cappuccino or latte and walk away while it's all being done, come back and have the perfect cup.  We haven't tried any custom settings yet.  The ones provided suit us just fine.  I like that the milk reservoir can be refrigerated since we have mixed milk with flavored creamer or with half & half and that has worked out well.  It comes with two filters - one single, one double.  Also comes with a scoop and press.  When you first turn it on, it does blink for about 30 seconds before it's ready.  I was impatient in the beginning and thought I was doing something wrong.<br /><br />Only major con is having to &#34;force&#34; in the milk reservoir.  There have been times that I didn't push in far enough because I was worried about breaking it.  One minor thing to watch out for...the double latte puts in a LOT of milk and has overflowed our coffee mug so be careful of that the first time you make one.<br /><br />As long as this outlast our previous machines then I'm very happy with this purchase, but only time will tell...",4,2013-12-25,,,,Had for one week so far...,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

You can also pull the creamer receptacle out easily and store in the fridge, and pop it in when in use.  The water tray also removes and fills easily though it seems rather fragile and thin to me.  The rest of the unit is solidly built enough, stainless steel accents and the filter are all metal.<br /><br />My suggestion is to get a normal coffee maker for everyday use and have this out for special occasions.  If you have the bucks to buy both, as this alone is about twice the cost of a normal one.  I was hoping for a coffee machine that 'did extras' as I saw all the buttons but this appears to be specifically an expresso and latte maker only.<br />HOWEVER......  as someone who currently works from home, I have to add that after buying a normal coffee maker for mornings, I have been intending to return this but instead I find myself making a latte every afternoon and looking forward to it too.

A much more significant problem though, is that I was losing a fair amount of water to overflow around the mechanism that holds the espresso, causing hot water to sputter & spray all over the place. Since it was outside Amazons return policy window, we decided to return it to the factory & they replaced it (we had to pay for shipping).

Purchased this machine for my deployed boyfriend and had it sent to him for the length of his deployment (1 year). The machine stopped working after 4 short months. The machine would boil the water but would not drip through. This machine was also used with bottled water only and had no build up in the system. With limited communication to and from him, I contacted customer support to discuss the issue. The customer service rep was unable to help with the situation because I did not have the machine. I explained to her that it was in another country and was not accessible and the limited communication with the soldiers. Not only did I spend money on this machine, but had to pay the additional $16 to ship it to an APO address. Now 4 months later, we are in the same spot because the product is unreliable.

It appears everything went well - it looks good, easy to operate, and it does produce decent steam to generate milk froths. The only problem is, it doesn’t make a good coffee, let alone a espresso. All it does is to let the cold water in the tank quickly pass through the heater and the ground coffee, making the coffee barely warm, less warm than a dripping coffee, which is exactly what most of the one-star reviewers complained about.

We'll see if it will stand the test of time.<br /><br />What does this unit do?  It makes great Expresso, Cappuccino or Lattes in either single or double at the press of a few buttons.<br /><br />What do you have to do?  Setup unit, perform initial priming per instructions and then keep water and/or milk in the appropriate tanks.  Note:  milk is only required if you choose to make cappuccino or lattes.  Yes you can use any type of milk (whole, low fat, organic or soy).  I assume you use 2% or cream but they are not specifically listed.  You'd just have to experiment to see if they froth and meet your taste requirements.  Put a fine grind in the appropriate Porta-Filter  (for single or double) and install in the unit.  You also need to place a cup under the Porta-Filter.  Once system is loaded you press a button once (for singles) or twice (for doubles) and you're in business.  From there the system takes over and makes whatever you have selected.<br /><br />After use cleaning is simple.  Turn a knob to &#34;clean&#34; and press the Latte button for 3 seconds.  This will clean out the milk frother.  You can leave milk in the tank during this process.  After the &#34;clean&#34; cycle runs you can remove the milk tank and stick it in the refrigerator until you need it next time.  Aside from wiping things off (as you would do with any appliance) there really is nothing special here.  Certainly nothing inconvenient.<br /><br />Periodically you'll need to clean the tanks (water and milk).  The water tank is NOT dishwasher safe and you'll have to hand wash it.  The milk tank IS dishwasher safe for the top rack.  Let's say this is a 5 minute job if you're having a bad day.  Remember you don't have to do this every day either.<br /><br />The Porta-Filter is NOT dishwasher safe and they recommend cleaning it every 90 days by disassembling (1 minute job) and soaking in warm water.<br /><br />Depending on water hardness you will have to perform a deliming every 40-80 brew cycles.  This is to demineralize the unit which again is something you'll have to do with anything that boils water.  This is more effort since you'll have to fill the water tank with vinegar and let it sit overnight.  Then the following day you'll have to run some vinegar through the unit to clean everything out.<br /><br />If I can get a couple of years out of this unit I'll be happy for the price.  If it fails before then I'll be back to update my review.

It makes a better cup than my Gaggia for 1/5th the price and does so with much less trouble.  Turn it on and mount the coffee cage while it heats up - voila!  The crema is much better than I get with the Gaggia.  In addition, the Gaggia is unable to draw a double without waiting for the chamber to reheat.  I have not tried to draw two cups, but a simple double is absolutely no problem for the Mr Coffee: a clean draw with good crema throughout and the smooth almost sweet taste that accompanies a quick brew.

They are not expensive and need to be replaced about once every couple of years if you use it every day - but they are way cheaper than buying cappuccino everyday, even if you buy the machine once a year! That is how I look at it.<br /><br />They produce great foam (I automatically remove the plastic cover that comes on the foaming apparatus and do not use it; I just don't need it and I feel like it foams it before it heats it - probably because I steam the milk right in my coffee cup, which is small compared to a foaming carafe).

I bought the protection plan, YOU SHOULD TOO. Aside from getting a lemon, protecting your investment is a big deal.<br /><br />READ the instructions before you start playing around with it. It is NOT automatic you do have to shut off the drip and pump for the espresso. But oh well. I have noticed that my grind doesn't make as much of a difference, but sometimes the leftover grinds are sludgy. I'm assuming that this has more to do with water temperature than anything else. So what i do to help this, turn the machine on about 10 minutes or more before i plan on using it. Then on the first cycle, i add NOTHING no grounds. I let the machine make 2 shots of hot water, this helps clean out gross stuff and it warms all the internal parts. THEN I start making my espresso. Clean up isn't bad. The amount of space isn't bad. If your drip tray is not in the right place, it will put water on your counter. (not fun before you have had any caffeine)<br /><br />The only downside for me is that it is LOUD. My significant other is gone every morning before I start this process, but it would def. wake him up if<br /> I wasn't.<br /><br />Buy it, try it, if you on the fence, this is good for beginners and caffeine freaks.",4,2018-06-07,,True,,"Easy to use.

3123,1,"I'm not a barista, but have owned those $20-$30 espresso makers for years and have frothed my own milk with them.<br />I got this for Christmas and I think it's great, but here are a few things to keep in mind.<br /><br />First, at this price point, it does a great job.  Especially frothing the milk.  It's nice to just press a button and it makes it all for you.<br />Clean up is fairly quick as well.<br />Keep in mind the price point though.  Don't expect this to compete with those thousand dollar machines.  There's a reason why this costs $800 less than those.<br /><br />2nd, In all the pictures, they show a full cafe style cup.  It takes 2 cycles to get that.  The espresso &#34;porta-filter&#34; can do 2 shots at a time, as opposed to most espresso machines which can do 4.  So to run 2 cycles, you basically load it up, press your drink selection twice, then you got to clean it out, and reload it for the 2nd cycle to get enough to fill a cup.  So that is a bit of a hassle.<br />I've looked at the Mr. Coffee website for a quad shot filter and portafilter (what they call the thing with the handle as it can't fit a larger basket than the double shot) and the double is the largest they sell.<br />I had hoped I could use the one from my espresso maker (it is a Bella) but it doesn't fit.  The it has 2 tabs while the the mr. coffee one has 3 so I can't line it up to use it.  Probably for the best.<br />That would really be my cheif complaint.<br />I'd like it to be able to hold enough espresso to do a complete cup full without me having to clean and reload the espresso basket after the first &#34;2 shot&#34; cycle.<br /><br />Something else I thought was odd:<br />In all my years of using those $20-$30 espresso machine, even when using a full 4 shot basket of espresso grounds, after making it, and removing the espresso grounds, they were always  dry, no moisture left as it had all been pushed through the grounds into the cup.  Makes sense.<br />With this Mr. Coffee Barista, despite trying different levels of grinding, I never get that &#34;dry brick&#34; of grounds.  It's always wet, runny, and once even had a puddle in it.  So it's like it's not even fully using the double shot of espresso grinds I give it.<br />I did read the complete manual before use so I didn't take any shortcuts.<br /><br />Overall though, I think it is a great machine for the price and I'm still new to using it so maybe I'll figure out these quirks as I get used to it.",4,2017-12-26,,,,"Overall it's great and worth it, but here's what I think could be better.","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
3124,1,"This was a great purchase.  It makes delicious, effortless espresso drinks.  The best part is the milk pitcher, which can be stored in the fridge when not in use... meaning that you don't have to fill the milk up every time you want a latte/cappuccino, and you don't have to throw away the extra milk left in the pitcher when your done making your latte/cappuccino.  That being said, it is not a perfect machine.  Here are some cons: (1) I always add an extra shot of espresso to my coffee drinks because I think that the amount dispensed is not enough to make a small latte; it's not a big deal, you just push the espresso button after the latte function is finished and voila, problem solved; (2) the finished product could be a little hotter - I like the temperature but my husband prefers a hotter beverage.  I have no reservations recommending this.  I will say that I purchased the 4 year warranty because some negative comments here suggested that the machine leaked or lost pressure over time - I figured that I would risk it because the machine is at a much lower price point than its competitors ($400+ less!!) and the warranty gives me 4 years of unlimited repairs/replacements/refund for a measly $10 bucks or so.",5,2017-03-03,,,,Buy with the super-cheap 4 year warranty - its a no brainer on price/value.,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

The coffee is excellent and easy to make and the frothing was excellent....especially with the Soy milk used for mine.  Simple and tasty.  If I had to complain about anything (and the person I bought this for pointed it out have a good deal of use)...is that the switch on the side does not allow for you to switch between one action to the other without activating the drip....which causes a small mess when it shouldn't.  It would have been easier to simply have 2 buttons to push...one for brewing and the other for frothing.....  That being said the rest of the experience is excellent and the coffee is very good!

I've made thousands and thousands of cappuccinos over the years! I've used a couple cheap Braun machines in the past - can't find them anymore. So now I make a cappuccino or latte that I'll take the Pepsi Challenge against Starbucks or damn near any other American coffee shop - with a $28 Mr. Coffee espresso machine and Jacobs coffee. That's right $28 here on Amazon - I just bought my second Mr. Coffee machine. The one I've had for 4-years wore out.

You steamed/foamed milk and now you need to pound on the counter to beat the foam down? Watch them closely someday - watch how much milk these numbskulls waste!

3128,1,"Although I did not purchase this from Amazon, (I actually got it at the W) I would like to write a review that may help people. First off, so far (and I have had this machine 1 month) this is the best Espresso Machine I have ever had so far. I ONLY drink lattes. I never have regular coffee at home. I only have regular coffee at work because unfortunately they do not have espresso. But this is really a great machine. I bought it because I have the Rivo and 1. It's really hard to find the coffee pods and 2. They are VERY expensive. The reason I like this machine so much if you can do many different combinations for your prepared drink. I have found my favorite brew is to push the espresso button once, then I push the Latte button twice. This way I get a single shot espresso first then steamed milk then a double shot of espresso again. Also, note that the knob on the front of the milk frother can be adjusted depending on how much foam you want. I usually keep it in the middle. I like a little foam but mostly steamed milk. I wanted to make sure you knew you can do many different combos. You can also push the button to stop it if you are getting too much milk.Sometimes I want a large cup so I will push the espresso button twice then the latte button twice. Also note you can add more froth by holding down the cappuccino button for 3 seconds then stop it whenever you want by hitting it again. I usually clean it every week by putting water with a small amount of white vinegar in the frother and following instructions for cleaning the machine with vinegar in the reservoir. Make sure your espresso grounds are not too fine or packed too tight or the the water won't go through. I like Lavazza Perfetto or I grind my own. Amazon sells a great coffee I buy by the 5 pound bag. Coffee Bean Direct. And I also like Lavazza's Super Crema. I think if this machine is cleaned regularly it will last. I may be wrong as I have seen some people have gone through several machines and I use this hard. 3-4 cups a day. So we shall see. I will do an update in a year.  Do not ever removed the reservoir. Just use a pitcher to keep filling it. This way you won't damage the port the water goes through and it won't leak. I have found this is the best way to prevent any damage.

Why not 5?  1) After brewing, there's always a little bit of coffee grounds stuck to the underside of the water discharge (above where the porta-filter attaches), which needs to be wiped off and is messy. 2) Our first machine broke within one week (would no longer pump water through the coffee/espresso porta-filter), but Amazon quickly sent a replacement and prepaid UPS return label for the old one, and the replacement machine is working fine after 3 weeks.  3) Once finished brewing, it continues to drip a little (unlike our Keurig), which means the little tray under your coffee cup always needs to be cleaned/rinsed.

3130,1,"I researched based on value. I wanted the best espresso for the least cash. I looked at many different options and chose based on our needs. I wanted a real coffee experience and not pods and the potential chemicals that may be associated. This is not as convenient as a pod machine, let me say that. However, I can choose my coffee, make my own blends, grind fresh roasted beans. In my research I discovered that coffee loses some flavor once ground and not used shortly after. Many coffee intellectuals seem to be committed to two things. First a high-quality grinder, some say to budget at least half of what you spent on your espresso machine. A good grinder makes for a consistent grind, maximizing your flavor. The other is that you grind fresh and high-quality beans. We have yet to experiment with fresh ground and I can gladly say I'm already pleased. We've tried Illy Medium roast and Peet's Major Dickason's Dark Roast. Peet's is great as drip coffee, but it shined in our Barista machine. I'm glad we spent the extra for the milk frother included with this machine. Minus a couple minutes to load the coffee, this is nearly as convenient as a pod machine (there is a bit of cleanup too, but something I can live with). You'll have fun trying the different options. I found I like to do a double espresso, then use the cappuccino button with the frother set to latte first, then to cappuccino froth (via the dial) for the last third. If you want to bump up your experience put a few drops of vanilla in your milk prior to frothing. I haven't seen any quality concerns, especially if you clean properly and follow directions. It appears leaving the coffee arm in the machine can weaken the seal over time. Also, slacking with frother cleaning doesn't seem to be wise. Again, it seems easy enough to clean. I think we may purchase the extended warranty, only because we enjoy this machine so much. In closing, So, I've purchased a manual ceramic burr grinder and will mod it with my drill (yes, this is a thing), and combine that with some fresh beans in my pursuit of very delicious coffee. I'm not the world's greatest coffee connoisseur, but I enjoy the finer things and pay close attention to culinary experiences. I've enjoyed very flavorful coffee further enjoyed when combined with the creamy/frothy milk addition. If Starbucks or the local shop is vastly superior, I can't tell the difference, I can only see the savings.",5,2017-01-04,,,,"This is the sweet spot for excellent, yet affordable coffee.","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

If your mug doesn't fit, you can easily pull out the tray (just be sure to wipe up the tiny bit of water than drains out of the machine, which is meant to go into the drainage tray) to fit a larger mug. You get a beautiful frothy top and a great tasting cup of strong, fresh coffee!!! If you want a shot or a cappuccino, that's all up to you!<br /><br />It's SOOOO easy to use.

I caught the reviews on this machine and decided to give it a shot since it was only $60. Much to my amazement, this machine  ROCKS! I've been using it DAILY making a minimum of (60-80oz) of Espresso for the 3 of us here for over 3 months now and it keeps running like a champ. (60-80oz) PER DAY is alot of espresso and a enormous task to ask of a $60 machine but this things handles it no problem.<br /><br />The Tamper isn't to hot but it works decently. Most people like to have their own special tamper anyways. Heat up is quick, the crema is plentiful, simple controls, & takes up little space.

For the price, I didn't care if I had to pay an extra $5-10 for a frothing pitcher ( I had one anyway from the prior DeLongi).<br /><br />When you consider just how much Espresso I've made so far, it could of died within the first month and I still would of saved a bunch of money compared to paying $4 a drink at SB. I have my beans ground at SB on their espresso machine setting which makes them very fine and this machine has no problem pushing the water through. I believe the secret lies in not tamping the grinds to much. When done correctly, very fine grinds produce a better flavor IMO. The adjustable frothing wand is a nice touch, but definitely toss the rubber tip. I'm so impressed with this machine for the money, I bought a 2nd one and stored it away just in case they quit making it.<br />I have made my version of a SB white Hot Mocha for dozens of my friends & neighbors and ALL say mine tastes much better than the SB version. I wipe off the grinds from underneath each time to keep the seal tight and to prevent any bitter taste from occurring. I also use water that's filtered through my home water softener system then through my R/O system (a must here in AZ as tap water is horrible) and that improves taste and no calcium build up at all yet.

3180,1,"This is a review for both the original one that I ordered with a defective steam wand, and for the replacement that came with the control knob that broke off my second time using it.<br /><br />I've had this machine before, albeit, it was ten years ago and I believe I bought it at Walmart, but I figured it could have only gotten better with time (I gave my old one to a friend, but it worked for many years with zero problems).  It also helped that the price had dropped and there was a $6 off coupon (I had been watching this for months, debating whether or not it was worth the purchase).<br /><br />So let's get down to it ... The first package arrived only in the Mr. Coffee box with a shipping label on it, which I was pretty peeved about, considering it is ""sold and shipped by Amazon.""  The box was also beat up, which concerned me since there were fragile elements inside like a FLIPPING GLASS CARAFE.  Luckily, nothing was broken.  I used it about three times before I realized the steam wand was just sputtering out yucky hot water into my milk cup, and I knew there was a problem, so I figured I would try again with a replacement.<br /><br />I should also mention, the multiple reviews that state that there are metal shavings in the water upon initial uses are absolutely true.  I flushed this baby out five times, and I still had little, itty bitty metal pieces in my carafe.  NOT GOOD.<br /><br />So the replacement is ordered.  I'm a Prime member, so I expected two day shipping.  I ordered the replacement on a Thursday.  It should have been here Saturday.  Apparently not.  I get a notice saying it's an hour away from me and also delayed.  The Amazon rep tells me it's being delivered VIA POST OFFICE.  Um, no.  That's not why I pay for a Prime membership.  So I'm annoyed but still patient and the package arrives on Sunday -- AGAIN NOT IN AN AMAZON BOX BUT IN THE MR. COFFEE BOX ITSELF WITH JUST A SHIPPING LABEL STICKER!!! Oh, and the box was beaten up and the tape was undone, so the side of it was partially opened.  THANKS, AMAZON!<br /><br />Everything looked okay inside said box, so I made a latte.  It seemed to work fine that night, but the next morning when I went to make another, while doing the espresso, the knob broke clean off -- so the other reviewers are correct.  THIS IS A TOTAL PIECE OF CRAP.

3181,1,"I have had this little espresso machine for about 3 weeks now. I really love it! I've read up on lots and lots of introductory information about espresso. I've watched countless online videos. Although I felt a little overwhelmed in the beginning, I think I'm starting to get a hang of how to use this particular machine. Here's what I've learned --- (feel free to correct me if you see that I've gotten something wrong!):<br /><br />In the beginning, I tried to to put 17 grams of fresh grinds from a conical burr grinder into the double basket portafilter. Seventeen grams was the number I kept finding online. I just couldn't make this happen. This was too much coffee. I finally came across a site where someone mentioned that some semi-automatic machines (which I think this is) have smaller baskets. The commercial portafilters and larger consumer machines have baskets that are closer to 53mm-58mm. This one is around 49mm-50mm. I dropped the grams down to 13 grams and that amount fits with very little brushed off the top.<br /><br />I tried tamping to the recommended 30 pounds of pressure, but found that the water couldn't get through the grinds very well - causing long pulls - even when I changed up the grind size to drip coffee size. After watching some videos of this particular machine with novices who didn't really tamp at all and seemed to be making great drinks, I found another site that stated pressurized portafilters don't require the same type of tamping because they are designed more for a novice with less room for error. Since this machine is meant for this type of user, I wondered if that might mean this is a pressurized basket. Again, correct me if you are certain this is wrong, but I do believe these are pressurized baskets based on the sloping screen forcing the water into a holding space before pushing through the bottom holes. I'm assuming that's why tamping at 30 pounds of pressure actually created a water holding puck instead of a brick puck.<br /><br />So, for science's sake, I tried to tamp at 15 pounds of pressure and found the water moved through at a rate of about 25 seconds for a double shot. The espresso was not bitter or sour and the after-puck wasn't water-logged. Although this tamp pressure is not recommended on the 'here's how you pull an espresso' sites, this seemed to produce a better tasting product. And that's ultimately what I wanted, right? :)<br /><br />At this point, I've made many lattes and affogatos (espresso over ice-cream). The only true negative I see is that the temperature comes out exactly drinkable, which means the drink cools VERY quickly. I wished that it came out about 10 degrees hotter.

3204,1,"After reading the reviews on this I asked for this for my Birthday. My very old steam Oster Espresso maker was literally on its last legs, and wow, I even hate to compare the two. The ECMP50 is so far above it, I can't believe I didn't get it sooner. The water reservoir is great, its quiet, it heats up FAST. . .I LOVE THIS APPLIANCE. Okay, I said it! I do not make many unequivocal recommendations, but if you are looking for a way to make your latte at home, this is totally the machine to buy. You can have a latte in your hand in less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />Like other reviews, its easy to use, I have not noticed any leaks - others may not be emptying the drip reservoir under the stainless plate - just a guess. It fills more quickly than you expect-I probably empty it twice a week and I use my machine at least once a day. I generally don't use a steaming can for my milk and just steam my milk in the mug. I have found that my stainless travel mug works great and easily sits under the steamer without needing to hold it there.<br /><br />As recommended by another reviewer, I do not use the rubbery thing over the frothing arm. I just cant believe its sanitary and the arm wipes clean easily if its cleaned right after use.<br /><br />I have a coffee grinder that allows you to select the fineness of the grind and the Espresso setting is perfect. (Its a Hamilton Beach, but I'm sure there are others.) Recommend grinding your own that way you know the grind is right.<br /><br />The only problems I've had with this have been user error! Like not realizing the water reservoir was dry and leaving my milk frothing too long and it boiled all over. What a mess, don't do that!

3206,1,"I bought this machine in September 2009 to stem the cost of my grad school latte habit. It's worked well for me for almost 4 years but has succumbed to the problems many other reviewers have had. About 4 months ago it began leaking from underneath. The leak steadily grew worse to the point that it now will not pump water through the grounds. This was actually the 2nd of this machine I had because the first, purchased at Target, did not work at all and was immediately exchanged.<br /><br />It seems like there are some design flaws that result in an inconsistent lifespan. My other issue with this machine was how short the frothing wand is. I don't always use steamed milk, but it was very difficult not to get A LOT of froth because the wand just didn't extend far enough into the milk (I always used a coffee mug because nothing else was short enough). It makes good espresso and mine had a nice long life, but it seems like that may have been the exception.",4,2013-06-19,2.0,,,Good for the price,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

3211,1,"Purchased this early May 2016 for $29.95 (model ECM160-NP) so I can save money on my twice-a-day lattes.  Very happy with how it works but it took some practice for the first five or six brews, so do not get frustrated. I found out that the key is the how fine the coffee is ground.  I found that the pre-ground coffee you buy at stores is too coarse for this machine. So, I bought a $15 Mr. Coffee blade grinder, and it works perfectly.<br /><br />Do not listen to the marketers when they tell you that you need an expensive burr grinder for espresso machines. You don't. You just need to be careful with an ordinary, cheap blade grinder. Do not use the grinder's automatic setting. I used three-second grinding sessions with its manual push-button, and shook the grinder in between for the coffee to even out inside the grinder for a consistent grind. MAKE SURE that the ground coffee grains are about only as coarse as salt.  I did once a bit too fine (like powdered sugar) and it made the coffee machine container jam. Check the grains consistency in between every two 3-second grinder runs.<br /><br />Also very important:  must tamp the coffee down in the coffee puck. I bought a $7 aluminum tamper (50 mm size) that works perfectly well. If the coffee is not well tamped down in the puck, the water just runs thru the coffee grains puck without giving rich espresso.<br /><br />I followed the instructions in the machine's user manual. The steamer arm on this model is fixed, not adjustable, and a bit too close to the machine.  I carefully forced the steamer arm with my palm to about an inch further away from the machine (measuring the bottom end) for more room for the milk pitcher to move around.  I also tried the steamer by screwing off the steel frother tip from the end of the steamer arm (inside the plastic cover sleeve) but it made the steam come out a bit too fast and in burst that made the milk splash all over, so I put the tip back on.<br /><br />I do not like much froth/foam on my latte, so I use 1% fat milk.<br /><br />Friends -- this machine works well, and it's less than thirty bucks!  How long this thing will last -- who knows.",4,2016-05-12,,,,Very happy with how it works but it took some practice ...,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

3268,1,"After a month of owning and using this product consistently, I have to say this is one of the best purchases I have made in years.  Sometimes you simply want a latte and not coffee.  The Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista provides a user-friendly, consistent experience that makes great lattes for pennies compared to what you can get at Starbucks.  When I set up the machine, the only thing that gave me concern was the water pump was not pulling the water in right away.  Letting it sit for about an hour let everything naturally fill up and I haven't had any issues since.  I also followed the top product reviewers advice and thoroughly cleaned the machine, running vinegar through it and descaling it.  Some reviewers have complained about this step but logically you would clean other dishes when you buy them from the store, why wouldn't you with this?<br /><br />I also bought the Gourmia GCG195 Stainless Steel Electric Coffee Grinder to provide a consistent grind (settings 4 or 5 work the best).  I use it primarily for two sets of double shots.  The frother is not great on the cappuccino setting but for the latte setting it provides a consistent result (I drink lattes so make your own decision on cappuccinos).  I also run one empty shot before doing anything with actual espresso.  It clears out any grounds and also heats the water more.<br /><br />The only criticisms I have of the machine is some of the design elements.  The drawer that comes out for taller glasses is great but the side plastic part being fully removed would work better so I could slide my tall 16 oz glass out of the way as opposed to trying to tilt it in.  Otherwise, it is really easy to clean and use.  My roommate and I use this about 5-10 times a week and we haven't seen any issues so far.  I would recommend doing a full cleaning every other month.<br /><br />I can't reitterate how user-friendly this purchase is.  If you simply want to push some buttons with little fuss, this is the machine for you.  I was not paid or given this machine for a review.  I bought it with the hopes that it was as good as the reviews made it seem to be.

As a barista I can say it's a quite decent machine, you can even pull off nice latte art if you use the frother bare, without the black piece, trust me, just throw that piece away. The milk will have better texture. The only thing thats kind of a drawback it that in order to use the frother you have to brew your espresso shot and in order to brew another shot you have to depressurise the machine, otherwise when you take out the portafilter, the pressure will escape through the grouphead and it will explode...and there will be coffee everywhere.

3279,1,"UPDATE ON 14 MAR 10:<br /><br />Well I originally had nothing but praise for this machine in the first month of operation but after that I became sorely disappointed with it. The frothing arm is too easily blocked. I clean the chamber and frothing arm regularly but it seems that after a few weeks, it simply won't steam anymore. Additionally, before it stopped steaming altogether, the blockage would cause what I considered to be a significant safety hazard. The machine would not steam, but then eventually explode spewing steam and espresso all over the kitchen. I still use this machine when I want a Cafe Americano or just espresso shots but I definitely regret buying it as I can no longer steam milk or do anything else fancy.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />First I'll preface my review by saying that while I like espresso drinks, I'm NOT a hardcore coffee snob. On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being ""I only drink hot chocolate"" and 10 being ""I only drink the finest coffees straight from Columbia,"" I'm probably about a 7.<br /><br />So when I decided to give my coffee maker a break and mix things up a bit, I was pretty intimidated seeing espresso machines running upward of $300. Clearly I was not in the market for something that expensive but I also didn't want something so cheap and worthless that I would never use it. This thing is a home run.<br /><br />It's easy to use, reasonably stylish, works great, and is priced just right. Although the process of making espresso drinks is much more involved than making a pot of coffee, I find myself going the extra mile often because the flavor is just so much more pronounced.  I really can make drinks on par with the local coffee shop for what seems like pennies (espresso uses fewer beans than a pot of coffee too)!<br /><br />You probably will need some practice to get the process down and find out how best to set up the machine for what you're trying to make (i.e., figuring out how much water you'll need to still have steam available after the espresso is brewed) but after that, it works great.<br /><br />I fully recommend this product and do yourself a favor and get a frothing pitcher, thermometer, and tamper to make it as smooth as possible.",2,2009-11-10,7.0,True,,UPDATE: Well I was thrilled at first BUT...,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

3298,1,"I used to have a steam expresso maker made by Krups.  It was terrible.  It was a little scary with the high pressure nature of the steam pressure chamber and I had a few problems with removing the filter holder too soon.  The milk frothing never worked well.  I quit using it because the results were so disappointing.  When the coffee maker side finally failed, we chunked it.  I didn't have another expresso / cappuccino maker until this Mr. Coffee one.  It has a pump and that is essential.  The end result is excellent.  Frothed milk that is as fluffy as meringue.  The grooved black plastic top serves as a ""drying rack"" for the filter holder and coffee scoop after washing.  The steam nozzle is movable to that it protrudes in front when you need it and then swivels beck underneath when you don't.  The removable water tank is easy to remove and easy to fill and re-install.  There are buttons on the front.  Push the coffee brew button and when the ready light turns green, rotate the side control down to brew expresso.  When your expresso is done, rotate the control up.  It does require watching the process, as noted by others, to cut it off before the brew is too weak.  Then to froth milk, you push the steam button and wait until the ready light stops blinking.  You then rotate the steam control up for steam.  I have a frothing pitcher but use a cup with milk in it and then pour the expresso over it after it is ready to save on dishes.  Makes great cappuccino.  I would highly recommend.<br /><br />I received a selection of Austrian coffees for a Christmas present.

If it gets too low, the machine will not use the last inch of milk in the container. I find myself wasting milk, and I hate wasting food. I have tried refrigerating the milk in the container after I make a drink then topping the container off with fresh milk before making the next drink. Also, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve forgotten to but the little metal frother thing in my cup before brewing, and ended up with a puddle of milk to clean ( okay the last con is totally on me). Don’t try making a latte when people are sleeping, it is super loud. Lastly, I find the espresso container really difficult to put in. Maybe it’s just my machine but I really need to put some muscle in to putting the darn thing in the machine.<br /><br />Pros: makes a descent shot of espresso. I don’t  like the lattes.

The cheaper ones rely on heat and the boiler to drive the water through the coffee basket.  The other upgrade with this machine is that the water tank is detachable, which means you don't have to turn the whole machine upside down to rinse out the tank, and this is definitely something you need to do sometimes with these machines. The machine produces a espresso shot with a layer of &#34;creme&#34; on top, as it should. This machine is priced at about a third of machines that usually have these features. In the past I've had high end Italian made machines.<br /><br />On negatives, the steam wand does a lousy job of frothing milk and cream. The steam flow is weak. Do you want a Starbucks style froth? You're not going to get it. I don't use it. The directions say to use skim milk. Sorry,  that doesn't cut it.  I either drink an espresso shot, or I heat up a little half and half in the micro wave for my morning cappuccino.<br /><br />The controls are strange.

I HIGHLY recommend never filling it above the half way.  The lid of the tank is not sealed or flat.  When the milk splashes into the screw areas, around the nozzles and other connections it is extremely difficult to clean them.  If you do not get every tiny splash of milk cleaned up your milk tank will sour incredibly quick ruining your next batch of drinks.  Do not think that you can simply run a cleaning cycle and get rid of the flavor either.  Grab your toothpicks, toothbrushes and get to work.

3326,1,"Update Jul 24th - Almost 18 months, it still works perfectly. If it breaks, I would buy another one. Check below the secrets to keep it always new.<br />Update Mar 9th 2018 - After 13 months I'm still in love to our Mr. Coffee Espresso Machine. My wife also loves it. We have been using it every single day, at least 2 times a day, sometimes up to 6 times.<br /><br />TIPS & SECRETS  ==========================<br /><br />Here are some SECRETS to keep your machine working, lasting longer and having more fun.<br />1- Use DISTILLED WATER to make coffee. Spring water is worst than water from your sink tap. More minerals on water, more metal residues on machine parts that will cause damage. Distilled water has no minerals. You can find it in a good grocery store. I buy mines on Wegmans.<br />2- CLEAN it. Always. Use the clean function after using froth milk, clean the water tank. Small milk of any other residues can damage any espresso machine within time.<br />3- Make MOCHA out of it, it's awesome. A good Chocolate syrup, whipping cream, added to the regular Cappucino. Cocoa power and some cinnamon powder.<br />4- Godiva's Chocolate liqueur on a cappuccino will add nice taste for hot weather.<br /><br />5- Use the froth milk to make a fantastic Hot Chocolate, but before warm the cup and drop a square of a good dark chocolate on it.<br />6- Espresso is supposed to be very hot in temperature. Always warm the cup with boiling water if possible.<br />Update APR 5th - After almost 2 months It works perfectly, I simply love this Espresso Machine. The automatic milk foam feature is fantastic. I've bought cocoa powder, cinnamon powder, Hersheys Dark Chocolate Syrup, Godiva Cocoa Liquor and Whipped Cream to make some awesome special coffees.<br /><br />FEB 9th 2017 - Loved !

During this period, I've finally been able to understand how to get the best out of this machine. When you use an inexpensive espresso machine, everything you do has to be perfect in order to get a good pour. From how fine your coffee grounds are, to making sure you have enough coffee in the pressurized baskets. Also just as important, tamping...make sure it's perfectly leveled and enough force put into it. That's the only way to get good coffee out of this thing. Once you get experience, you will be getting great tasting coffee in no time. I have noticed that the machine takes time to get the water at the right temperature, which is very important as well. I don't know if this has happened over time but I always have to switch it on and wait for about 40 minutes until it's prepared before I can make the coffee. Anyway, that's all there is to say about it. If you're buying this then you have to be prepared to put a lot more effort into making your coffee than you used to.",3,2016-11-19,11.0,True,,Preparation is key to getting the best out of this machine(6 months use),"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

3342,1,"For starters, as you read the reviews, you'll note some people reference the water reservoir leaking. Yup. It can happen. I played with it to see how bad the problem was, and it seems if the reservoir is moved from side to side a bit, the water begins to leak. Lifting the reservoir up and down didn't seem to cause that problem.<br /><br />I knew of this potential going in to my purchase, and ultimately chose to keep it.

3372,1,"We had purchased a $300 espresso machine, during the day to use for our family dinner before Christmas Eve last year, from a department store, by a major brand name. Had all off the recommended features, First machine made it through two cycles, both were very weak and not acceptable, then the pump failed and it peed all over the counter. Never made another cup. We went straight back to the store and got a replacement unit that only lasted most of the night. We then upgraded to a different manufacturer and paid over $400. This one made it  almost a week, before the pump failed. Took this one back and did not buy another one. This year, my wife suggested that I get a cheap unit just so she could have a latte at night. I bought this with a $30 gift certificate and took the slow freight ($9 out of pocket). You have to experiment with it a bit to get it just right to your taste, but it has been great for the espresso for the latte. We also found that it works better if you make the espresso, then put more water in and stream the milk as a separate operation. Just make sure you don't leave the coffee carafe in place or you will weaken your espresso. My wife was drinking a latte every night ($5) plus gas. Now she makes one when she wants it and we just use a pound of coffee every two weeks. Maybe the $1000 are better, but don;t waste your money on the $3-400 ones.",5,2012-12-06,,True,,"Cheap, but Effective.","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

I did note that there were very polar reviews on all of the cappuccino machines, but this had the most 5 star reviews so I thought optimistically that I would try out this product.<br /><br />I received this shipment on Friday and began happily making frothed beverages. Unfortunately, there were two instances when the froth only was produced and the espresso did not dispense, but with a quick reboot I was back on my way. However, it is now 5 days later and the unit has completely stopped functioning.

The price was good for this sturdy little machine; it doesn't take up much room on the counter, and the flat top is ideal to store things.  I experimented only twice with the amount of coffee required to make a (very) tasty cup; experimenting is necessary due to personal liking, and grind and type of coffee.  The machine is quiet and fast.  The more I use it, the more I like it.<br /><br />There are some cons, for me anyway.  The screw-on cap for the water reservoir is nice to look at, but is totally non-ergonomically shaped.  It's almost impossible to get a good grip on it because of its sloped sides and smooth texture.  The handle on the side to turn for ""Steam"" or ""Brew"" is very similar and difficult to use.  I don't like these at all.  I also don't like the lag time between cups because you have to wait awhile for the pressure inside the machine to drop before unscrewing the awkward cap.  And super-lefties beware:  the carafe MUST be poured with the right hand because of the placement of the little ""V"" in the carafe where the coffee is diverted to flow into a cup.  I'm an ambidextrous lefty so it's not a problem, but the first time I tried to pour using my left hand, I saw this could be an issue for lefties.<br /><br />All in all, I'm satisfied.

3468,1,"I bought mine at Target but Amazon sells the same machine. This machine seems to have been designed and manufactured but never tested by anyone who had ever made espresso. There are two flaws in the design. First, the cup that holds coffee grounds is tapered towards the bottom so that a standard 49 mm tamper fits less than halfway down. If you don't fill the cup almost completely you can't adequately tamp down the coffee. A machine shop milled down my cast aluminum tamper for $10, so add that to the price you think you are paying for this machine. (Don't buy a stainless steel tamper; it's harder to mill.) Second, the holes in the basket are too large, so the water flows through the coffee too quickly. This makes a weak brew. A standard shot is 7g of coffee, but for me to get a decent single shot of espresso requires 10-11g, which fills the basket to the line marked 2 before tamping. That means spending half again as much on coffee beans, which will add up over time. The large holes also let too much finely ground coffee into my cup (I don't bother using the little carafe), creating sediment in the bottom. I could grind the beans more coarsely, but then the coffee would be even weaker. For 20 years I used a Swiss-made Krups steam powered espresso maker which was basically the same as this one, except without the design flaws, so I know how it should be. Alas, Krups now has their machine manufactured in China like every other company that sells these simple machines. It doesn't make sense to buy a $600 pump driven machine that takes a lot of care and feeding for 1 shot twice a day, so I'll use this one and hope it breaks soon so I can try again.",1,2016-06-07,,,,Design flaws make this machine expensive to use,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

3500,1,"Amazon is great, this machine sucks. Within the same day I shipped this thing back, they are already processing my refund. Could write a drawn out explanation. But basically, I followed the instructions, wasted about 4 hours and almost a half bag of coffee trying to get this thing to work. It did work OK for lattes, but for cappuccinos, it did not froth, nor did it produce that beautiful crema on top of the espresso. I am usually a pretty handy gal and am good at troubleshooting, etc. I tried every setting, etc. Finally I called Mr. Coffee number and I couldn't even talk to a person, just like an automated troubleshooting recorder. They told me that I needed to clean it out with vinegar, run the cycle several times, then rinse with water. But the problem is it never worked, so surely it isn't already ready to be cleaned! I may have just received a defective one....I guess that happens. My patience was running too low and finally decided to return. I wanted it to work!!!!<br /><br />However, if I were you my advice would be to continue researching and for not much more you can get a REAL espresso machine.<br /><br />One suggestion I do have if you order this thing is don't start with the quick start guide. There is no quick start, so I don't know why they include it. You have to start by rinsing out all the pieces, then remove all the tape. THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER PITCHER HAS BRIGHT RED TAPE THAT IS ON THE BOTTOM THAT HAS TO BE REMOVED!!!! ALSO IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, THAT WATER TANK HAS TO BE AT THE MAX FILL FOR EVERY CUP, EVERY TIME. ALSO, THE MACHINE HAS TO BE PRIMED BEFORE OPERATING. DO NOT READ THE QUICK START, READ THE REAL MANUAL UPON OPENING.<br /><br />Good luck!!! Mr. coffee, please come out with a higher end machine that actually does what the picture shows!<br /><br />Update: I did more research and ended up getting the nespresso lattisima plus machine and it is amazing. It makes authentic latte macchiatos and cappuccinos. The cost is over 350, well money spent plus it comes with a free sample pack of capsules you can try for different strengths.

3514,1,"We can't seem to keep an espresso machine working for more than 1 year, so we decided to go with a little inexpensive model. And it always holds true, you get what you pay for, or in this case, maybe even less. The water reservoir doesn't hold enough water to brew the coffee AND foam the milk if you're trying to make two cappuccinos at a time. There is no control for the amount of steam - it's either off or on.  Anybody that really knows how to foam milk needs to be able to adjust and control the steam. And if you try to unscrew the water cap to add more water, you run the risk of being burned by the residual steam. Also there's no movement with the steaming wand which makes it harder to use. The basket assembly for the coffee grinds and the drip tray are very cheap.

3532,1,"Update December 2012:  When I first purchased this machine, I wasn't very happy with it as my below review reveals.  However, since writing it 20 months ago, this espresso machine has provided me with daily lattes despite its issues. I'm revising my rating to give this little workhorse the credit it deserves. It's a great machine for the price, but don't expect years of service or to operate as the specs outline.  I've found in the three espresso makers I've purchased, they last between 1-2 years.  My current Mr. Coffee ECM160 is on its last legs, as the frother screaches more than froths the milk, even with daily cleaning, but I will be replacing my Mr. Coffee ECM160 with another just like it.<br /><br />Review April 2011: I first purchased a DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker from Amazon about 14 months ago.  The machine lasted for about a year and then just stopped working.  But, during the time I had it, I became addicted to having a latte every morning, so when it died, I started looking for a replacement.  I decided against purchasing another DeLonghi as the prices had increased significantly and it only lasted a year.  Based on the reviewer ratings for the Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine and the price, I decided to give it a try.  Since receiving it around 2/25/11, the machine is prone to not brew the coffee and the frother never does the same thing twice.  Sometimes when I turn the frother on, the steam starts immediately, other times, I have to wait for a few minutes and then this cannon of steam shoots out and makes a small explosion sound.  In addition, sometimes I hear the water boiling for the coffee side of it and other times the water starts pouring as soon as I turn it to brew.  It's my own fault for buying cheap chinese goods.  I hope to keep you from making the same mistake unless you have money to burn.",4,2011-04-10,,True,,Two Espresso Maker Reviews,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

3572,1,"If your looking to get a good cup of strong flavorful coffee..it's great.<br /><br />However, I suggest that you use good quality freshly ground beans.  As for an actual espresso with the sought after and coveted crema...don't expect it. I've tried everything to squeeze out the ""crema"" in the ground beans (and this machine)..and nada. I used the Safeway brand beans to a great quality locally roasted bean here (Coda) in the Denver area, and I still can't get it.  I may have to resort to Illy or Lavazza and try those. Maybe it's this machine..or maybe it's me.  I've gotten better results from an actual espresso pot than you can do over the stove.<br /><br />BTW...the reason I bought this machine was that I burned up my espresso pot since I forgot to add water and all the plastic parts on it melted off. *sigh*  I've had a few other espresso machines in the past 20 years..but I haven't had one for a while, so instead of replacing my burned up espresso pot, I bought this machine at Target for around 30 bucks.<br /><br />The frothing wand is too short to really get down into the pitcher and the little black ""perfect froth"" attachment is useless, so I ended up tossing it alltogether and got slightly better results, but the wand is still too short. The carafe works fine to hold around 12 ounces of water (or more..a little more) but the silly lid can't hold on when you tilt it; it flys off and you have a mess on your hands, so I have to hold it on with my thumb while pouring.<br /><br />It'll make a decent cappucino, but no great shakes. Again, since I'm missing the ""crema"" factor with this machine, I'm knocking off another point. But it will make great iced coffees.<br /><br />The tamper that's built into the scoop is useless. Buy a decent metal one.  Also buy a decent frothing pither that's not too deep or too shallow.  I use a Bodum 2 cup french press carafe as my frothing pitcher, works pretty good actually.<br /><br />SO.. if your looking for Italian cafe quality espresso with that great thick crema, don't look here. But If you want a decent cup of coffee with cream or a decent cappucino or iced coffee, it'll work for you hands down.<br /><br />One side note, the electrical cord is too short for my taste, I know there's a wind-up feature on the bottom of the machine to make it as low profile as possible, but our kitchen doesn't have a lot of wall sockets, and I have to unplug another appliance to use this machine and my surface real estate is at a premium. In the future I am going to build out a wet bar/coffee bar and thus, install more electrical outlets. (In addition to my coffee making hobby, I'm also into mixology, so I figure I'll kill two birds with one stone)<br /><br />But the future will have to wait...",3,2011-08-13,,,,For the money..it'll do its job..,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

It just takes too long since you can pull espresso and steam like right after. you still have to wait for your milk to steam for a long bloody while (160 is the standard cause 140 is warm). tamper sucks. doesn't come with a pitcher. filters are too damn small, even for a double shot. you basically need to buy a stainless steel tamper and the RIGHT size pitcher (12oz)... otherwise the wand won't reach. there are too many accessories you have to buy along with it as if you're not already paying a more than $50. as for me though, i'm really impatient (but not willing to ruin quality so i'll never get a kcup machine) and this.... is so slow by the time you have to switch brewing to steaming. I know the starbucks rule is a shot cant be left for longer than 10 seconds which is probably something they made up for promptness but since it takes about more than 50 seconds for my milk to even go to 140-160 the shot is ruined. i was hoping to find a good budget machine but now i feel like i need to consider Breville Barista express because my drinks take too long to make.

There is no way to heat the water before you brew so you're stuck with brewed coffee instead of steamed coffee-which is what makes espresso espresso. When you follow the instructions in the manual and wait for the initial &#34;brewing&#34; of the coffee and then turn it to steam, all the unit does is shoot out a stream of water from the steamer. The plastic used is very cheap-during my first assembly of the unit out the of the box, the portafilter handle broke off. This thing is an utter waste of money. Its an expensive, 8 oz regular coffee maker and for the price, there are much better espresso makers that make actual ESPRESSO.",1,2017-06-02,,,,Waste of money,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
3614,1,"I bought this with a gift card, it was the only one available within the price range at target..<br /><br />This does pretty much what it advertises, but just not quite as good as it should.  My issues do not arise from not including a tamper or frothing pitcher.  They arise from the fact that it seems the company has not actually used this product.<br /><br />The frothing wand leaves much to be desired.  You can not get a good microfoam on the milk, especially not with the frothing ""aid"" attached.  It would be much nicer to have a bit more room to work with on the wand, it is too close to the body of the machine.  The IMUSA machine seems to have a much better solution to this (and at the same price).  I have not used it though, so i cant say for sure.  Another reviewer did suggest putting a foam attachment onto the wand, which seems like a good idea, but where would one find this type of foam?  i would like to know!  The back of the coffee scoop is supposed to act as a tamper, however, since it has rounded sides it fails miserably.  If it were made with a completely flat bottom, with 90 degree sides, it would be A LOT more useful.  These are simple things, that could be fixed without increasing the price.<br /><br />The switch between brewing and frothing can be a bit tricky to get down.  How i have done this is i put a bit more water (at the mid line of the metal ring around the pitcher) in when i am getting ready to brew, and stand by the machine as it brews.  Once the pitcher fills to the 4 cup line, i switch to frothing.  I dont think this could be fixed without increasing the price, so no points off, but it is still a bit of a hassle.  If you dont measure it correctly, you have to refill the reservoir, and wait for it to heat up the extra water before you can continue frothing/steaming.  Then if you put too much in (as in, the amount suggested on the pitcher), you will need to grab a glass of water to release the extra pressure before you use it to brew again.<br /><br />Overall, the product does what is advertised, but HOW it performs the tasks could be improved.",3,2009-06-19,5.0,,,"An ""OK"" Product","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

I just use strong roast store-bought coffee and make about 5 shots of espresso with this machine each morning; pour it over ice, add some half/half, and stevia and it tastes great.

I need my jolt in the morning and this gives me just what I want and need without a big fuss and break the bank feeling.  It's so easy to use and easier to clean.  I have to say Mr. Coffee is really keeping up with the compatition and this is a great machine for a portion of the price of many others and you get as good if not a better quality drink.

No regrets at all!  I'm glad I didn't shell out for a much more expensive model.  For me, it's perfect.  I had my first 2 cups of cappuccino in under 30 minutes today, out of the box.  My boyfriend wanted another, and once I had the hang of it, it probably took about 3 minutes to made another cup.  I did notice that I needed to add a little more water to the reserviour after brewing to get adequate steam for frothing. The rubber tip on the steamer is my only concern- it doesn't look too sturdy, and I'm not sure how long it will hold up.

3644,1,"I received this machine as a gift in advance of a family get-together. Said family member who gifted it is a self-admitted espresso addict, so expectations were high that this machine could perform as well as her $300 machine back home. And for around $30 you're probably as skeptical as we were. But skeptics will be delighted.<br /><br />No, this doesn't make an authentic espresso or latte, but it makes a pretty darn close beverage for a fraction of the price. The espresso addict and the former barista family members were very pleased with the ease of use and the end result. When the coffee addict's $300 machine at home broke after a couple of years of use, she bought one of these to replace it.<br /><br />It doesn't come with a tamper or a frothing pitcher, and in my honest opinion, neither are needed. We just steam and froth the milk in the cup we're going to drink out of, then add the brewed coffee in. I've always found you tend to waste an obscene amount of milk with a frothing pitcher anyway. We just have a 12oz glass mug, about 1/3 we fill with milk, steam and froth away...then add the coffee in on top.

3671,1,"Arrived today, 4/7/2017. Read reviews about milk never coming out the spout. After following the instructions to a &#34;t&#34; the espresso poured beautifully but no milk came out. After a bit of troubleshooting, I realized that there was no mechanism for the milk to go up from the reservoir to the frothing component. After some digging, we found reference to what amounts to a silicone straw that was missing from our package that goes in the reservoir. Additionally, instead of one single- and one double-shot basket, we received two single-shot baskets. We will be calling customer service in the morning for replacement parts. Three stars for now. Will update review after parts are received and the machine is functional.<br /><br />Update 4/8/2017: Called Mr. Coffee at 1-800-672-6333. After some frustration with the robot AI, I finally got to speak to a representative. Hint, just say &#34;representative&#34; and it will get you over to someone. The rep was quick and professional. He shipped the silicone tube and double shot basket to us; I didn't even have to prove that I had purchased it by providing the model number etc. He stated it should get to us by 2-3 business days. So far, excellent customer service.<br /><br />Will update after parts arrive and we can actually test it. We also purchased a Mr. Coffee grinder along with this espresso system, and will be reviewing that as well.<br /><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Coffee-Automatic-Burr-Mill-Grinder-with-18-Custom-Grinds-Silver-BMH23/dp/B004T6EJS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill Grinder with 18 Custom Grinds, Silver, BMH23</a><br /><br />Update 4/14/2017: We received the replacement part on Wednesday, exactly 3 business days and 5 days total after I contacted customer service. Unfortunately, it was the wrong part. We received the &#34;frothing tube&#34; instead of the &#34;silicone tube.&#34; Naturally I forgot to call before work yesterday, so I called this morning. I'm downgrading my review based on this interaction. Firstly, in my original call, they did not order me both parts requested and obviously because they ordered me the wrong part. Secondly, during this call, upon hearing that the double shot filter was not in stock, and the machine was therefore unusable, I was told to ship the entire machine back to Mr. Coffee to receive a whole new machine.  And to call back within 48 hours... I cut her off there. Considering that I have two single shot filters that I can use in the meantime, this was outrageous. More time and effort over a machine that I purchased brand new and have yet to use. Moreover, it took considerable restraint and perseverance on my part to get the customer service representative to actually locate the correct missing part to make the machine usable, the silicone tube, despite my telling her that I had located it on the replacement website and it was in stock, and that I had the model number in front of me during the call. She had me get up and look at the metal prongs on my coffee machine to give her the code etched there prior to her taking the model number. Then when she found the part, and I asked her to tell me the name of the part that she was ordering  (for confirmation)  she told me the wrong part! I had to correct her. Hands down the worst customer service experience I have had in a while for a machine that came to me missing parts. I really hope this is all worth it, because we really are excited to use this machine.<br /><br />Update 4/19/2017: We purchased the double shot filter over Amazon, it got here yesterday. We got the shipping confirmation for the silicone tube... It was shipped 6-8 business days. Ordered 4/14, shipped 4/18, then we'll get it 6-8 business days. The first time I called they shipped it 2-3 business days... Only the wrong part. Ridiculous. Had the machine narly 2 weeks and haven't been able to use it, and it'll be another week before the part I asked for arrives.

The espresso maker is easy to use and makes great espresso, my crema turned out perfect. I think the only negative thing I have to say about the machine is that it's a little noisy and I'm also getting soupy grinds after I make my espresso. I'm not sure if I'm tamping the coffee too much and it's causing it trouble or what the deal is. I think this may be user error :) But other than that I absolutely love it! My recommendation would be to go ahead and buy the little espresso cups as well as a milk frothing pitcher while you're at it. The drip tray is removable and you can fit a normal size mug down under there however I think it's nice to not have to remove the drip tray since some water may come out when you are finished frothing your milk. I also went ahead and removed the rubber cap on the end of my frother and it's made no difference in its ability to froth but it has made it much easier to clean. I read a lot of reviews that stated the machine only hade a lifespan of a year or two but really for the price I paid then I'm ok with that, I wouldn't mind replacing it should something happen to it. It takes me about 10 minutes to make a cappuccino, but I'm pretty slow at it as well so I'm not sure, as time goes on I may get quicker at it. I'm also using a little flavored Torani syrup in my nonfat milk when I fix cappuccinos and they turn out yummy. So overall I'd definitely recommend this machine, if a newbie like me can make a good cappuccino then anyone can!",5,2012-05-22,,True,,Perfect for a beginner!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

I loves me my coffee and espresso and work part time at Starbucks to support my habit, but have always wanted a espresso maker at home.  This machine is horrible.  The espresso it made was ok, not too bad, but sometimes it took as long as five minutes to spit out the espresso.  Often times I would sit there and wait for something to happen, turn it off, turn it on, turn it off again, wait, turn it back on, and so on before it would work.  And forget about frothing the milk.  It worked for one day for me, and I was foolishly thrilled that I could make frothed milk at home until it stopped working. Then I was sad.  Now all I get are sad little bubbles. and the milk doesn't even heat up at all. My Tassimo does a better job 'frothing', and that doesn't say too much. Not to mention I try to steam the milk with the frothing aid and it sucked up the milk into the water reserve, and when I tried to make expresso the next time around It came out milky.  AND you can't use espresso pods in the machine because the pressure is too weak.  And yes, the electric cord is freakishly short.  We're talking like three or four inches.  The only plug in my kitchen where it will reach is right next to the sink and I freak out every time electrocuted.  So, in short, I will be stuck with this machine because I do not want to hurt my friend's feelings, but if you want to buy a espresso machine either shell out the money for a real one or at the very least spend the extra 30 bucks to get a higher quality machine NOT from Mr. coffee.",1,2010-02-11,5.0,,,I work at Starbucks and know my espresso-this aint it,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

On the plus side, with this one you can control exactly how much milk you can froth or heat.<br /><br />Minor cons:<br />-- The frothing arm could be a little longer, some frothing pitchers are tall and if you just want to froth/warm up a little bit of milk, the arm won't reach down too far so you have to fill up the pitcher with more milk than you'll use, which is a waste.<br />--- You have to twist the filter basket really hard to get it to lock, which bring concern with durability (the basket is stainless steel but the locking mechanism in the espresso machine might be of a softer material that could wear out over time, especially if you make coffee several times a day).

3752,1,"I have several cautions for extending the life of this machine:<br />1.  I replaced 3 ECMP50 coffee makers until I watched a few YouTube video clips and realilzed what DESCALING involves and thought I'd add a few words to those mentioned below.  The scaling takes place in the heat exchange unit internal to the machine.  You don't see it.  If you don't regularly descale your ECMP50, the metal seals in the heat exchange unit will clog, split and ultimately leak ... the cause for my 3 replacements.  To avoid this problem, add descaling to your calendar about once a month.  The directions are OK in the manual although I use a regular descaler rather than vinegar.  The gunk that comes out tells me it is helping.<br />2.  The only other leak (unless something is seriously defective) arises if you steam milk and forget to empty the overflow tray at the front of the machine.<br />3.  The frothing tip is made of LIGHTWEIGHT ALUMINUM and WILL STRIP after you remove and reinstall it several times.  Consider buying a replacement 1-hole tips to have it ready when needed.  Clean the tip after frothing.  Steam into your container filled with water and then wipe down the tip.

3753,1,"My husband and I bought this espresso maker in September of 2012. For the first year, he wasn't making more than one espresso a week on average. Sometimes more, sometimes less, but I'd say one per week is probably about right.<br /><br />But late last year, in the winter of 2013, I became addicted to espresso. He taught me how to use the machine so that he wouldn't have to make one for me. I was having one almost every day.<br /><br />In June or July 2014, I can't remember exactly when, I noticed that water was all over the kitchen counter after running the machine. That was the beginning of the end.<br /><br />I put off buying a new machine by just folding kitchen towels underneath the espresso maker before running it. That catches most of the water. Unfortunately, though, the machine is also losing pressure and the espresso isn't dripping out the same. Also, it's annoying to have to dry soaking-wet towels EVERY time I want an espresso. I'm cheap, but I'm not that cheap. I knew it was time.<br /><br />I finally gave in and purchased a new espresso maker. Which one? The same one as before: the Mr. Coffee ECMP50.<br /><br />Now I acknowledge that this machine has a pump defect and that 1-2 years of shelf life with regular use is probably the most I'll ever get out of it, but as far as I can tell from the reviews of other machines in this price range, pump problems are common. If not a pump problem, then they all have their other issues, so I can take my pick.<br /><br />If you're buying this espresso maker, it's because you want something more than the ""non-espresso espresso makers"" that are really just brewing strong coffee (and cost half the price), but you're not looking to drop $500-1000 on a professional unit. If that's you, then this one is as good as any. The espresso is delicious, the machine is basic and very easy to use, and although you'll have to buy another one in a year or two, that's probably true of a lot of these cheaper models.<br /><br />So before you buy, ask yourself if you'd rather spend a lot of money up front for something higher quality that'll last longer and has more features OR if you'd like an introductory machine that makes delicious espresso that's much more affordable, but will need to be replaced much sooner. I opted for the latter.",3,2014-10-06,49.0,True,,Affordable basic espresso maker that will need to be replaced after a few years,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
3754,1,"This is my first coffee machine. I don't drink coffee, but cappuccinos looked so good I had to buy this to see if I could at least enjoy coffee substitute cappuccinos.<br /><br />It didn't take long to learn how to use this machine. It froths milk and almond milk very well and delivers great tasting herbal (coffee substitute) drinks. Clean up is very fast. Here are some suggestions for use:<br /><br />1. If your milk container won't push on all the way, the rear o ring on the machine behind the milk dispenser needs to be shaved down so it is not so thick. Remove it with a small hook and shave the outside of the ring SLIGHTLY with small scissors and then put it back on. I gave the machine only 4 stars because end users should not have to modify the machine this way to get it to work properly.<br /><br />2. Leave the Porta Filter in place for awhile before removing it. This allows liquid to drain from the puck so it is dry enough to dispose of without making a wet mess in the garbage can. If water does not drain, you can open the Porta Filter slightly to break the pressure seal and then it will drain.<br /><br />3. Use the flip up retension lever on the Porta Filter handle to hold the metal filter in place when smacking it against the inside of your trash can to quickly empty the filter without losing the filter itself in the trash too. (I only mention this because the instructions didn't tell me what the retension lever was for and I had to figure this out).<br /><br />4. Don't use herbal coffee substitutes that clog the filter. The instructions say this will ruin the machine. Ayurvedic Roast Original French Vanilla is one example that should not be used with this machine. Teeccino Mediterranean Herbal Coffee Vanilla Nut works just fine. So does New Life Coffee Substitute (if you like the soy flavor).<br /><br />5. For the most froth, I put the steam-froth dial 2/3 of the way toward the froth setting, not all the way.<br /><br />6. Leave the milk spout pointed out towards the cup always. It's too easy to forget and start a cappuccino with the spout pointed straight down, and then you have no small cleanup. I store and carry the milk container to and from the refigerator in a bowl with the spout in dispensing position. It is very convenient to manage this way.<br /><br />7. I put both metal filters that came with the machine upside down on my drill press and widened the bottom hole with a 1/16 inch drill bit being careful not to push through the microfilter plate below the hole. Whether this affects pressure and final flavor, I don't know. What I do know is that the bottom hole and the inner chamber behind it are much easier to keep clean.<br /><br />I like this machine. I'm glad I bought it. The drinks it makes taste better than what I can make heating water on the stove, so there must be something to the pressurized water passing through the grounds in the right amount of time. Now that I have tasted the difference, I am a believer in these machines.",4,2014-01-30,15.0,True,,Works very well,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

3786,1,"Firstly, for the beginner or average espresso drinker, this machine is superb and an unbelievable value for the price. I've had no issues with leaks. Also if you're going to buy a espresso machine, make sure it's pump driven...Don't fall for those ~$30 steam powered coffee incinerators.<br /><br />I've used expensive machines in the past, and I normally wouldn't even consider an espresso machine under $250 but I wanted something cheap for my college apartment.<br /><br />For the espresso aficionado like myself, I have a few gripes; If you're not SERIOUS about espresso just skip over these:<br />1. It uses double wall filters. Yes, it takes a lot of guess work out and makes it easy to pull a decent shot, but also takes away part of the experience. I would have liked to see single wall filters included.<br />2. The steam wand is either 100% FULL ON or OFF. It's also almost impossible to purge the wand. When you turn it on for a moment to purge and then back off, it thinks you're done, the pump recycles, you have to press the steam button again, then it takes another 10 seconds or so before you can turn it back on. This is probably the most annoying thing about the machine.<br />3. The steam wand is underpowered, it can hardly swirl milk in a 20oz frothing pitcher. Not surprised for the price though.<br /><br />General Tips:<br />1. PLEASE don't use pre-ground coffee. It's far too course and will have long oxidized by the time you take it out of the package. Get yourself a quality burr grinder that allows for consistent finely fresh ground coffee.<br />2. Take off the stupid rubber foam enhancer/silencer. It does nothing but introduce far too much air into the milk, making huge bubbles.<br />3. Get a nice stainless steel frothing pitcher AND milk thermometer. Ideally you want to surf the milk until about 100*F and then dive it deeper to texture until about 140*F.<br /><br />If you don't get a grinder and milk thermometer, you might as well just forget about getting an espresso machine and go to Starbucks.<br /><br />That's my take on it. Feel free to ask questions. :)",4,2011-07-12,4.0,,,"Great for the price, but a few gripes for the espresso aficionado.","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

3788,1,"Going on 2 years.  Doesn't make creaa on top of the espresso but still makes very good espresso.  Excellent cappuccino maker with plenty of foam.  Easily makes hot milk. Quick to bring water to boil. Buy a coffee tamper to compress the grounds in the portafilter basket(Terry's tamper works great and is cheap) because it can make all the difference in the taste of the espresso.<br />Espresso Tips: Pour filtered water into reservoir then leave cap loose and power it on while preparing to get the coffee ground. Measure the coffee into the filter then tamp it down. (Italian coffee grounds is much smaller than American grounds.) Put the filter and carafe into place and the water should be making a rumbling boiling sound.  (To prevent burns, if you see steam is already coming out of the top then turn power off and wait until the steam stops then screw cap tight and turn on.)  If you don't see steam yet, quickly screw the water reservoir cap tight.  If you put Italian coffee in, it will take more time for the espresso to flow through than American sized grounds. out.<br />Cappuccino Tips: I make mine in directly in a coffee cup. Put skim or up to 2 percent milk into cup about 1/2 or 3/4 full.  Whole milk doesn't foam as well.  Sugar as sweetener tastes better than honey. I submerge the steam team in the mug before turning on the steam.  After 15 or 20 seconds, the milk is hot then I raise it until the steam tip is just below the surface and the foam is rapidly forming. Shut off then pour espresso into the milk.<br /><br />Broken glass replacement carafes can found on Amazon.",4,2010-05-22,3.0,,,Makes good espesso and great capucino at great price,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

3790,1,"I had an $80 per week Starbucks Latte habit.  I know my espresso drinks and am picky about flavor, temperature, and foam.  Recently, I began looking for a home espresso machine to help cut down on my coffee expenditures.  I have had a Starbucks Barista that I spent over $400 on.  It never made good coffee and the steam feature worked so poorly that it would water any milk you tried to heat up using the steam wand.  Then it broke and just didn't seem worth the expense of fixing it. I began looking for a new machine a few weeks ago.  It seemed based on reviews that I would have to spend $500-$700 for a machine that could make decent espresso.  Well, I have a kid in private college and I'm looking to save money at this time, so though it might pay for itself over time, the spotty reviews on the high end machines kept me from making the expenditure.  I finally decided to try the very inexpensive Mr. Coffee ECMP50.  I figured that relatively speaking, it was so inexpensive that if it goes out in a year, I could still buy one yearly for several years and not pay what the high end machines cost.  I didn't expect much.  Boy was I surprised.  The machine makes a really good cup of coffee and has enough power to produce a nice crema on top.  The steaming wand works really well.  I heat my milk up a bit first to get it going, but the foaming action is great.  So far, I'm really pleased.  I'm still experimenting with the fineness of the grounds since I like my espresso fairly stiff, but the coffee I've gotten so far is robust.  Best of all, my machine will pay for itself within a couple of weeks with the savings I'm achieving over retail lattes!  Good job Mr. Coffee!

3892,1,"I got this on sale at the big red bullseye for 32$. I've never owned a cappuccino machine, but drink a lot of regular coffee everyday. I do like vanilla lattes, so I decided to try out one of the machines. It's it on a very small counter space and has the small glass carafe that the coffee brews in, some machines don't come with anything, you have to supply your own espresso cups or the like.<br /><br />After having the machine for a few days and making around 10 lattes or so, I decided I did like having the machine, and decided I would buy a more top of the line machine. I went and purchased the delonghi ec155,  which was 3xs the price at 100$.<br /><br />The first thing about the DeLonghi, did not come with a caraffe, and I had no cups small enough, so I had to use a little bowl. The first annoying thing about the so called better machine. After reading the instructions it tells you to let the machine get to temp but turning it on about 10 min before you were going to use it, second black mark, as the Mr. Coffee,  starts brewing in only a min or so. So I did that, got it to temp, and turned it on to brew. Bump..bump...bump, it was like a miniature jackhammer on my counter. The Mr Coffee is very quiet, & I guess because it doesn't use a bar type system of pressure like the delonghi , which from what I've read is a better system, hence the hundred dollar price tag, the mr. Coffee, can brew very quietly.<br /><br />Next was the frothing arm, it's too low on the machine,  so if you have a decent sized frothing pitcher, you're going to have to hang it off the side of the counter, third black mark.<br /><br />The next thing I didn't like about the DeLonghi is the tamper for the grounds is attached to the machine, I guess you will never lose it, but it's much harder to tamp like that with the brew basket, rather than holding the brew basket still and tapping it with something that could move around, it's like holding your holiday lights still and turning your Christmas tree to string them on.<br /><br />Anyway,  after three trips to the big red bulls eye, needless to say I paided $29, yes it was on sale when I went back, so I actually saved another $3, and cost me $29 and change, it's happily parked on my counter. I'm sure the DeLonghi it's a great machine, but I much prefer this one. Noise wise, space wise, the mr. Coffee just works better for me. And the most important part, I love the lattes it makes.<br /><br />I just wanted to give buyers an idea about which machine might work better for them.

3894,1,"The machine works decently well, particularly at this price point.  However, it is not without flaws, particularly as regards longevity.  My wife and I are very heavy users.  We probably make (between the two of us) 8-10 drinks each and every day.  I think that I have probably owned just about every brand that makes a sub-$200 cappuccino/espresso machine (DeLonghi, Krups, etc.).  The fact is that at the sub-$200 price point, some of the components are going to be relatively cheap regardless of the manufacturer.  The longest one of these units has ever lasted me is three years, and that was a $200 machine.  This Mr. Coffee unit makes good espresso.  The frothing functionality is only so-so, and the frothing wand is somewhat cumbersome to clean.  After 10 months, the unit started leaking out of the bottom (while making espresso, but not while frothing).  My guess is that one of the components has sprung a leak that appears when the system is under pressure.  Given all the negative reviews regarding Mr. Coffee (i.e. Jarden) customer service, I was prepared for a nightmare trying to get the warranty honored.  Imagine my surprise when after asking me a few questions, the customer service rep told me that they would immediately ship me out a replacement along with a prepaid shipping label to send my existing unit back to them.  It was as easy as could be.<br /><br />So, I figure that between the original unit and the replacement I will get a couple of years of use out of these machine.  At a $60 price point, that's pretty good.  Most of the competing machines are &#62;$100, and many are $150.  They are, IMO, no better than this one w/respect to the quality of the espresso/cappuccino.

3896,1,"This machine makes decent espresso based drinks, but sucks the fun out of it.<br /><br />1) Potential health hazards / clean up. There are 15-20 pieces to clean. The parts dissesamble into individual parts, and because of the steam and milk involved in this machine, not thoroughly breaking it down to its individual parts and cleaning them often will result in mold build up.<br /><br />2) Leaking / Mess: This machine is inheriently messy. Some have said it is not, I feel it is and here is why. The frother shoots milk past your cup. The part where the shots are poured from continues to drip well after the coffee is made. It’s a juggling act to switch my cup of coffee with an empty cup to catch all the drips, every time I make coffee, resulting in another cup to clean.<br /><br />3) Coffee grounds in coffee: leak through into coffee cup, resulting in gritty coffee occasionally, I’m using grounds that are ground up by a barista at a coffee shop to an espresso machine’s appropriate specs.<br /><br />4) Durability and self-cleaning: certain parts feel they are close to breaking after one month, despite me using baby hands with this machine. Specifically the nozzle used to switch from latte to clean mode (something you must do each time, in order to clean the inner parts of the machine, which it does not do well, resulting in my having to use q-tips to scrape out old milk and prevent contamination from the tubes.) because this part is so crucial and used each time, it was a poor decision to use a cheap plastic and rotator mechanism for it.<br />This has already resulted in the machine not registering the proper setting occasionally, and preventing me from making drinks on the first try, a jiggle to the part is needed to get it to work.<br /><br />5) The default size of the drinks are quite small. Maybe 6 ounces for the large setting. I’ve not tried the small setting because of how puny the finished drink looks in my coffee mugs. My small tea cup size mugs do not get filled. Large mugs are ¼ filled.<br /><br />6) Time: after one month of owning this machine, knowing its kinks, and how to combat them, it takes 10-15 Minutes to make one latte, and do a bare bones rinsing of only the essential to clean parts, waiting for the dripping to stop, etc.<br /><br />There is probably more I can not think of.

3897,1,"Review with updates<br /><br />Initial review: May 2014<br /><br /> Unit just arrived and was setup today. I'll do my best to keep this concise, (I'll try). Well packed, good instructions. Unit did leak at seal-point, (bottom)of water reservoir, this is a common complaint. Contemplated tossing back in box and returning but this is not my style. Pushed reservoir side to side at base when in place, (full of water). When pressed to one side the leak increased, the other direction water remained sealed. I cleaned male insert at base of reservoir. Then I wiped down into clear silicone type seal on unit. I then carefully inserted a small round screwdriver to the seal slightly lifting the seal and working around it in an effort to re-seat it within its housing. The seal is tough in material, don't be afraid, but do use good judgement. The reservoir was set back in place and it no longer leaked. I am absolutely sure there was no debris causing the leak, the leak was a cause of the seal being out of alignment with the spigot on the base of the reservoir.<br /><br />I then ran through the priming sequence and made test drinks of all sizes and types. No problems, worked great! Tried a mocha-latte using my morning standard coffee cup. Two shot filter, Lavazza black can, filled filter and tamped/pressed until felt firm. Froth to latte, 1 tbsp of Hershey liquid chocolate. Left spoon in cup, placed in machine and selected double latte. Swirled spoon several x's as milk came out, (used 1% milk), removed spoon. Unit dispensed espresso. A final couple spoon mixes and ready to drink. Hot and pretty darn good, I was surprised it was as good as it was.<br /><br />My final impressions: Makes a good espresso and whatever else you want. Don't freak on the tamping thing, follow directions and use coffee ground for espresso! Changing the coffee, (e.g. dark Lavazza or Blu...etc), milk type will make biggest differences. Appearance of my spent coffee in filter was tight, clearly no air pockets. And what you've been waiting for; THE LEAK? Well, so far it has not returned. If it does I update this article otherwise you'll not likely hear from me soon. I believe the seal problem is a quality-control issue with assembly, which is why some people have no issue and others do. Could the seal itself need an engineering change, maybe, hard to tell at this point. I'm sure Sunbeam is well aware of this no matter what customer service may tell you.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Here is my rationale for this machine; it makes decent espresso drinks quickly and easily. You'll still go to your Barista on occasion for fun, that's life. The more automated design allows consistency as many variables are reduced. This matter alone makes it a better home unit choice than a far more expensive manual unit. Spend $1000 and you'll not likely be any happier with the taste, in the end. Not as impressive maybe to look at, but if this matters to you then open your wallet and pass on this unit. Rather than spend $1000 or more I recommend giving this unit a try given the price gap. If you encounter the infamous ""leak"" think about what I wrote or trade for another unit. It's worth the hassle in my opinion considering the ample savings. Star rating? I based on espresso ability/quality, not the leak issue. If my unit continues to leak or has any problem of this nature, it will be returned for refund, end of story. Then it receives (1) star and a nasty-gram in this review. Enjoy your buzz.<br /><br />UPDATE: Jarden sent a new water reservoir in an attempt to resolve the leaking seal problem. Their customer service was immediate, too immediate as you'll read. The problem is the new reservoir is identical to the original so there is no chance it would seal better. Fortunately my fix method of re-seating the seal is still working, (see above)  and I am exceedingly happy with the espresso drinks I make with this machine.<br /><br />A COUPLE MONTHS IN: All is fine. Been making 2~3 drinks per day. Unit is somewhat inconsistent with dispensing milk volume. This should not be seen as a problem. Why it does this is difficult to confirm. Differences in milkfat, time unit sits before brew, barometric pressure, humidity %, etc? (You see my point). Consider a Barista will mix manually to maintain consistent volume so automatic is bound to show small variations. I'm not talking about liquid running out over the cup, I speak of froth. Always fill the milk container to the full mark as this does affect dispensing. To assure perfect volume just run manually. A 2-shot?, press 2-shot espresso followed by press/hold the cappuccino button. Fill with milk amount you want, push button to stop, perfect every time. Have tried Espresso pre-ground from Trader Joes, pretty darn good. Ground espresso roast from Trader J in their machine at espresso setting, consistent but a bit coarse. Taste however was quite good. Do grind in a high quality grinder or risk plugging your machine and damaging the pressure side of system. Be adventurous, try different coffees, enjoy. Still saving me a ton of money over going to coffee hut.<br /><br />Oct 2014:<br /><br />Still works fine, must give a 5-star. I do see some people report fails after a year. If mine dies I come back here and tell you. Automatic tends to be messy at times due to the reality foam varies a bit, typical when making drinks. You simply can't think the drinks will not over-flow foam on occasion if you try to use the standard coffee cup.<br /><br />Ever notice a Barista makes them in separate containers and combines? I'm suggesting you do similar. This is what I've found to works well: Use a 1 qt pyrex or similar size container to initially make the drink. This assures there will be no mess from over-foaming the cup. Warm the pyrex and your cup with some hot water if you can, keeps the drink hotter. Mix your drink in the pyrex then pour into your favorite cup. Foam comes out last, scoop it in to the top. If there is some left over I suggest not pouring it down the drain. I've gone to the Cafe Bustello vs the Lavazza or TJ's. Lavazza is good, no complaints. But for the price difference I favor the Bustello. If you drink raw espresso, this is another matter and you'll simply have to experiment until you find the flavor you enjoy.",5,2014-05-30,3.0,,,What you are getting into?

I love a good espresso so my friend thought it would be nice to get me my own machine, knowing little how much goes into properly prepared espresso and that this machine will never cut it ( part of the reason I shell out a few bucks at a proper cafe with a proper machine). This machine gives you virtually ZERO crema and crap tasting espresso, which is far more bothersome than some of these other reviews that are mainly complaining about the tamper and the frothing jar -- not a big deal. Seriously, what you get here is basically blacker coffee and a machine that give the illusion that you are making espresso.

3900,1,"I am like one of the other reviewers that found this machine to have a good core design and features but it never fails to die just after the warranty period runs out, usually before 18 months.  As such I have bought at least 6 or 7 of these over the years...to the tune that of I have lost count.  While Mr. Coffee has tweaked the design to improve certain things on this model (notable over the last 10 years) but they never fixed the leak issue and took quality hit for the cost reduction.  This things leaks like there is no tomorrow.  If it didn't leak at day 1, it will definitely develop the leaking issue, it's just a matter of when.  No amount of proper maintenance (cleaning and de-calc) will prevent or cure these issues.<br /><br />The Chinese workmanship quality on this machine continue to drop over my 10 or so years of owning these machines, over various design tweaks and production year.  Don't let the price reduction fool that, you are not getting a bargain - you are getting a cheaply made unit and it's getting cheaper and crappier each year.  The plastics are no longer properly trimmed and/or polished, so that there are sharp, skin piercing corners/edges all over this machine.  The water tank lid is now slightly bigger than the tank itself and no longer closes properly.  The selector knob could break if you are not super super gentle with it.  Leaking issue has now grown.  I just had a brand new unit leak out of the frothing wand during brewing...  And my new unit had burning plastic smell if you make more than 1 drink at a time - heating up the unit definitely releases a very unpleasant possible toxic smell.<br /><br />Of the 6 or 7 units I have owned, only 1 unit was in good quality with no issue but it succumb to 2 shots a day after about 2+ years.  The rest had pump ceased, or started to develop dangerous leak right around 1 year warranty period.  Leaking at the tank connector area, or leak collected at the bottom from some internal plumbing leak, or leak from the bad connection to the drip tray, and now leak coming out of the frothing wand when in standby or brewing mode, which should have kept the wand water path fully shut.  Basically, this model has leak issues from every conceivable orphus.<br /><br />My advise to you is to skip this machine and go for a comparably priced DeLonghi. While DeLonghi low-end machines do not have features of this unit, mainly build-in pre-infusing and wait period, and a standard nozzle-on-the-tip frothing wand, the DeLonghi's are much much better in workmanship quality.

Be sure to clean and regularly maintain the unit, and I'm confident you'll get plenty of use/enjoyment out of it.<br />My advice/warning would be regarding the steaming tip: be very careful when screwing/unscrewing the tip, as it's threads are super thin and quite easily able to be mis-threaded. Don't over tighten it either; finger/hand tighten is enough to keep it securely on without allowing steam to escape. (If you DO over-tighten and/or mis-thread the tip, it will be almost impossible to remove it without breaking the stem....trust me, I KNOW!) Lastly, I would suggest running the steam tip into small cup/serving pitcher with water immediately after use, to prevent milk from hardening and clogging inside the stem/tip, as well as keeping the outside clean and free from dried-on milk residue.<br /><br />Overall, after owning this espresso maker for nearly 5years, I think this is a great product, at a great value, and I highly recommend it!",5,2016-12-28,,,,"Highly Recommended for overall quality, price, performance!","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

So over the years when I bought smaller machines for at home, I bought the little bit more expensive inexpensive machines with names that sounded fancy. I avoided the Mr Coffee one because... well... it just didn't sound right. My old one was starting to have issues but was still working. I decided to try the Mr Coffee machine and if I didn't like it I would give it to my son and his wife, and keep my old one until it died and then I'd buy a new fancy-named one. Turns out... I love this Mr Coffee espresso maker!!! Why did I wait so long to try it!! Except for grinding the beans, it does everything in one step. So easy! And it tastes amazing!

I use Cafe Bustelo and have never had an issue with this brand having a burnt taste to it (in general) and when I used it for other espresso machines. I'll likely venture out and try other brands of ground espresso too at this point.

It's pretty thin, and without it, the steam doesn't get dispersed as much, making the steamer less effective.<br /><br />2) the glass pitcher's handle broke off. There is a small screw that holds a metal strap around the glass, which holds the handle on. The screw sheared off during hand washing, and the whole assembly fell apart.<br /><br />3) the thing that holds the espresso in place while it's brewing seems slightly misaligned, and so now it doesn't make a tight seal.

3923,1,"UPDATE**************************************************************************************************<br /><br />July 30, 2014 - A couple of years later and still no issues.  Not sure what has been the problem with all those bad reviews.  This machine has been used almost every day.  We don't have reverse osmosis water filter or even use bottled water.  Water straight out of the tap.<br /><br />Still going strong with no issues.  Pulls are hot with nice crème on top.  Heats up within a about 30 seconds.  No flashing lights unless you turn the knobs the wrong way.  No gasket leaks - we wipe the basket gasket after each use. No leaks on the counter.<br /><br />The steam wand gets clogged every once in a while, but that is due to poor cleaning.  All you have to do is take off the jet with a pair of pliers and clean out the jet with a pin.  Probably could prevent that with a shot of steam after every use, but I think the kids are lazy.<br /><br />My 18 year old is about to move out and the fight has already started about who gets the machine.  Guess we will end up getting another one and even though there are a ton of negative comments, I just don't see that we will have any issues.<br /><br />Will update if we do.<br /><br />UPDATE**************************************************************************************************<br /><br />January 21, 2012 - And still a great unit.  Everyone in the house had adopted our little friend.  Absolutely no issues being used a couple of times a day.<br /><br />Want a variety of really different but sometimes questionable coffee.  While you travel, grab those extra packets in the rooms.  The 1 cup variety fits perfectly in the small shot, the 4 cup fits a little short on the 2 shot.  Cut open the little bags.  I feed them to the teenagers here and keep the fresh ground roast for myself....<br /><br />Having fun with Mr. Coffee<br /><br />Original review Decmember, 2011**************************************************************************<br /><br />We have a 4 person family and this thing has been running almost non-stop since we got it.<br /><br />Not only has it been on our counter making continuous cups all day, my teen age sons have taken it out almost every night to parties over the holidays.  On Christmas eve alone, we did about 50 pulls with ablsolutely no issue.  Family of 25 coffee drinkers couldn't get over how good a cup the unit produces.  And it is easy enough for just about anyone to use.  Point out a couple of the controls and it starts producing coffee in about a minute.<br /><br />So as for the bad reviews...<br /><br />1.  Break down and get the matched Mr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill. Model number BVMC-BMH23.  In the manuals, it talks about having the right grind for Espresso and calls out this model on the fine setting for a perfect pull.  So no one is an expert barista around here, but using the 2 diffent size filters gave perfect pulls every time - even for the 8 year old serving grandma.  If you use the right grind, you will save your pump and keep from overflowing.<br /><br />2.  There is a water tray under the cups on the front of the unit.  Excess water is ejected into this tray.  Keep it emptied.  If you don't, you will have water on your counter (duh).<br /><br />3.  On the box is a picture of exacty what you get in the box.  And a full size standard 16 oz coffe mug (ya know those ones with 'I Love Mom' on the side) will fit under the filter with no issue by tipping the cup just slightly as it goes under.  For large cups you can take off the tray.  As far as the cups shown as suggestions for serving on the box, they don't come with the coffee maker and the don't have coffe in them either.  Come on - look at the price and break down and get a coffee cup and a stainless steel frother.<br /><br />4.  I just burned my mouth on a pull.  The water temp is plenty hot.  Now for reading the instructions.  When you first turn on the machine, let the check light stop flashing.  Hit the steam button and clear your steam wand for 30 seconds.  This starts the heating process for the water and clears the wand of a little built up water.  It will spirt that little cold water for just a second.  The instructions say to run the wand in water in your frother for 30 seconds, but I just take my towel and put it over - recleaning the wand (because the teenagers are really lazy).  If you go through this process when you turn the machine on and when you refill the water you will get the right temp coffee.<br /><br />5.  Blow through your wand for a few seconds and clean it after every frothing.  Another thing I have done is to lose the rubber cover for the frother.  It works as a jet, but milk browns to the wand and is very hard to clean up.  I would say a real bacteria issue after a while.  My teenage sons who had gotten used to the jet told me the frother then didn't work.  It is an art then of placement of the wand, temp and cup position to get a good foam on the milk.  If you can't figure it out, go to you tube and watch some video.  Not one of the professional machines have a rubber 'crutch' on the frother.<br /><br />I just went back and read the reviews and it looks like all are related to the grind. So, as for all those leaking issues, try using the right size grounds and see if that helps.<br /><br />As far as this family is concerned, we have pulled maybe 100 shots and had absolutely no issue.  At this point, the machine has paid for itself (if you consider the cost of that high priced corner store). Even if it was to blow a gasket at this point, I would still say it was one of the best purchased I have made.",5,2011-12-29,6.0,,,Highly recommended after 2 years use with no issues,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
3924,1,"I have used this machine regularly (not quite daily but a minimum of twice a week up to every day of the week) for about 5 years. Still works great. I haven't even had to replace the carafe - and I am clumsy!<br />The machine takes some practice to get the espresso just how you like - trying different roasts and grind settings - but I like that. The instruction booklet was helpful and I have never really had a brew turn out horrible. I can use different brews and grinds depending on the flavor I want for the day and I enjoy that optional versatility versus say a Keurig type machine.<br />I don't use the frother, however, so I can't say anything in regards to how that works or its maintenance etc.  When this machine dies (which I don't see happening soon), I will gladly buy another one.<br />I would highly recommend this to someone who likes espresso drinks but doesn't need a top of the line type machine.

You heat up water in a cup and pour the expresso into it.  ""Drowning"" the expresso.  So smooth they do not need milk, or sweetener.  Better than Starbuck's.<br /><br />A very simple machine.  A metal pressure chamber that can hold 4 shots of water, a knob that operates the steam valve and also turns on the electric heater of the pressure tank.  Three positions -- steam, off, brew.

It's a glorified coffee pot; and I use the term &#34;glorified&#34; in the same way that we call prostitutes, &#34;Ladies of the night&#34; - as if semantics is really the problem with their chosen profession. This machine is worse than a coffee pot and the only thing it is good at, really good at, is making an utter and annoying, steaming, raging mess. I wouldn't have a problem with it NOT being an espresso machine if only it didn't make me livid when I have to clean up after it.

No, I'm not having sex with it, not for money at least, but I spend nearly as much time cleaning up after. The portafilter of this bathos fails to make a seal with the group head.

The only thing to do at that point is to run away and hope to not get any mess to land on you. So why do I keep it? Mainly, it was ridiculously affordable and by now, I've tossed the box.

3994,1,"To the engineer that posted detailed instructions on how you should use this machine.  Your a genius!  I have followed your advice from day one and not had one problem with this unit.  This is a great little machine for not a lot of $$$$.  I have saved a lot of $$$ making my own latte's.  Sorry Starbucks I love you but.......  I can make my own now :)  I<br /><br />Here are the instructions I follow.  If you follow the directions included with the machine to a tee your going to get disappointing water logged coffee. But if you have a basic understanding of pressure and steam you'll need to modify your operation of this little machine. What I do is fill the coffee filter holder to max shot coffee level line and use a coffee tamper to compress the espresso but don't pack it to tight just a simple tamp is all you need because your going to want to stop the excess water rush when the thick black coffee and cream stops pouring. I use only purified water unless you want your machine to last only 1 year from mineral deposits, and I fill glass carafe to reach the bottom of the metal band to ensure more than enough water and steam to do the job. With everything in place i.e. power off, coffee filter holder fully locked in, steam cap screwed down tight, frothing arm extended and ready with cup and milk standing by... I then turn the machine to knob to steam first to allow the machine to build pressure and steam without prematurely diluting the coffee filter holder, as soon as the frothing arm starts to sputter and produce steam with a hint of water I quickly switch the control knob to brew coffee position which brings in only hot steam and water trickling out only dark thick coffee and this is where you have to be rehearsed to act fast and operate the machine effectively! With the thick black coffee trickling, get your milk cup ready sitting under the frothing arm ready to be lifted up as soon as you see the brewing coffee go from slow tricking thick dark coffee to cream foam. It should have reached the first like on the coffee pot at this point.  Now GET READY to turn the control knob back to steam the INSTANT you see that the slow dark cream foam trickling out slowly starts to speed up. The moment before you see the slow dark cream foam trickling out start to speed up to water, I Instantly raise my milk cup submersing the frothing arm under the milk to avoid splatter while simultaneously switching the control knob to steam, which instantly stops the brewing process to the coffee filter holder preventing water dilution. Turn the knob slowly once on the steam side and work your way up to full steam if you switch too quickly you will get a milk volcano lol.  Once your milk is frothed to your liking. switch the control knob to off. That's it, perfect Espresso.  Be sure to once you've made your coffee clear the rest of the steam from the unit once your done and clean the froth arm.  I wipe the outside of the plastic cover then take it off and wipe down the metal portion to clean the steamed on milk off.  Then I replace the plastic cover and turn the steam back on to clear out all the rest of the water and steam from the unit.  This will clean the frothing arm but also release all the pressure that has built up in the machine.  Once all the steam is released take the lid off the top of the water compartment and let the machine cool.  Doing this when not in use will help prevent premature compression damage to the sealing gaskets, I only slightly keep both the steam cap and the filter holder screwed in place. If you lock them down to full tight position when not in use, I find that it will prematurely compress the sealing gaskets and they will start to leak early making brewing ineffective. Having said all of this, as a protective disclaimer I must say that this is what “I DO” and I'm not recommending any of these operating actions to anyone. &#34;You should use the instruction book to a tee for OK strong watery coffee if that's what your after.&#34;  Thanks E.

3995,1,"I just ordered our second one of these. The first one lasted 16 months, averaging about 5 double shots per day. It recently developed an internal leak that is related to the inexpensive and fast PEX type fittings used in assembly, so repair is more trouble and expense than it is worth.<br /><br />I purchased the replacement with a 4 year replacement warranty offered by Amazon, so when it also fails we can hopefully get another at no cost.

The steamer wand is also poor. My old machine had a separate power switch, a expresso on/off, and a steam control knob. This has only an expresso and a steam position that also turns on the power. Unless steam is on full blast the heater is off. Coffee, NOT expresso, starts flowing as soon as temp light comes on so you get mostly water instead of steam.

So for Christmas, hubby bought it for me (he actually remembered that I had wanted one!).  I was so excited to try it out...but wow I had no idea what a headache it would be. Now maybe I'm a tad spoiled from the ease of my Keurig brewer, and the simplicity/taste of our french press, I don't know.  But not only did I have to read the directions several times before using the machine, but I had to keep the booklet on the counter next to me to follow along while I was preparing my coffee.  Here are my main frustrations:<br /><br />1. Seriously how many ""DO NOT""s can you have in one set of instructions??  It sounded dangerous and confusing already.<br />2. You can only pour in the exact amount of water you think you'll need for just that use, and if you didn't add enough to steam your milk, then you have to completely shut the thing off and unplug it before you can open up the water reservoir to add more.  By this time, your coffee is sitting there cooling off.<br />3. Coffee takes a long time to brew for the small amount it's brewing.<br />4. The frother is just ridiculous.  It bubbles.  That's it.  Plus, you're supposed to move the pitcher in a circular motion--how?  You hit the side of the machine because the frother points straight down.  ALSO, because it bubbles almost out of control, I had hot milk splashing on my counter and other appliances.  Making coffee should not be this messy.<br />5. The taste was sub-par.  Wasn't awful, but I like my coffee shop lattes, and this just didn't cut it.<br />6. Basically, this machine is a slow coffee brewer with a milk ""frother"" on the side. You could use your own regular coffee brewer/french press (which is so much simpler), and then just use a hand-held frother.

4142,1,"I love this machine. I used to have a Starbucks Barrista which was incredibly noisy and, not being an expert, difficult to get the foam I like on a cappuccino (either too bubbly and not creamy enough or too thin a cream). This does virtually all the work for you and makes a very nice creamy foam (as shown in the picture is definitely accurate). Hint: lower-fat milk (e.g., 2% rather than whole or cream) makes more foam. I use it every day.<br /><br />DO remember to extend the spout for the milk over the cup - I forgot to to do this once and what a mess to clean up! Also, be sure to use a large enough cup to accommodate all the creamy foam it makes (if you like it foamy). Fortunately everything comes apart. The only detraction is that the spout/rubber hose are a bit tricky to clean. Running water through to &#34;self-clean&#34; it doesn't do the job adequately; but using a q-tip and a toothpick to get any residual milky clots out works fine and rinsing thoroughly helps limit this. (I don't necessarily rinse every day because I simply refrigerate the container if I happen to have any leftover milk in it.)",5,2015-01-14,,True,,I love this machine,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

4144,1,"Overall I love this machine. It took a few tries and my smart daughter to figure out how to get milk, since the instructions don't mention inserting the small, flexible tube into the milk chamber lid. Now it produces terrific espresso with plenty of crema on top, and very tasty cappuccinos and lattes in assorted sizes and with adjustable froth. The only oddity now is that, after making several drinks in a row it seems to only want to make a single instead of a double, but I may just be pressing it's little heart to much! Love the cup warmer shelf on top, the slide-out shelf for demitasse cups, and being able to just pop the whole milk  container into the fridge. Much better than I expected for the money, especially after getting it ""Used-Very Good"" for sixty bucks off the regular price! There was no indication the box had ever been opened<br /><br />Additional  10/30/2013: This machine is rocking along. Figured out using the manual override to make larger drinks and only occasionally use the automatic settings anymore. Someone asked a question about storing the milk container in the fridge with left-over milk and I told them, yes you can and the instructions say the same. I would now say to just pour the milk back into the carton because, after a day or two, the milk leaves a hard-to-clean scum line on the plastic container.",4,2013-08-16,,True,,Wonderful Device,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
4145,1,"I have been using one of these for one year.  The strength of this machine is the convenience of pressing one button and then being able to walk away.  In practice however, you actually do end up staying close to the machine to prevent overflowing foam because the volume of foam is dependent on the type of milk/cream and its temperature.  If you are a nitpicker, the foam is not consistent; it has a &#34;hard&#34; top layer (like laundry suds) and the desirable  &#34;silky&#34; foam is underneath.  So I ended up spooning off the top 1/2 inch of &#34;hard foam&#34; every time.<br />The most important thing about a coffee maker is that It makes a good tasting cup of cappuccino, and this one does - equal to Starbucks.  (after I learned Starbucks little secret of adding a tiny bit of heavy cream to the bottom of your cup - it makes all the difference!)<br />Then after about one year of use the foam apparatus just stopped working.  I replaced it with an identical machine, and the foamer didn't work on the new machine either, and so it went back.  So two broken foamers on two identical machines gives me very little confidence in the foaming system.  Having to buy a new machine at $165 per year makes this a very expensive buy!",2,2016-12-26,6.0,True,,"Beware, more expensive than it seems …","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

4148,1,"This was a gift I got for my husband. For a couple months I went back and forth between this and another espresso machine. I read reviews and learned how each worked. In the end I decided to order this one because while we drink coffee, cuppacinnos, and lattes often, I wasn't sure how much use this would get. I wanted to save a bit of money just in case. Overall, I and my husband, are very happy with this machine. It works well and very quickly considering it's affordable price point. I saw reviews of it being loud but that is the nature of an espresso machine. That said, if you are steaming milk, if you create a layer of foam first and then steam the milk the foam insulates it and keeps it from being obnoxiously loud.<br /><br />We had some issues with one of the two spouts being clogged right from the beginning even after running water through it nearly ten times. (Highly recommended! Run it repeatedly until you no longer see that yucky film or haziness in the water.) To solve this we just cleared out the clogged spout and it works better. It still doesn't force the same amount of water through on both sides but it's nearly equal and likely a result of the way the machine works.<br /><br />As far as quality of espresso goes, I highly, highly recommend getting a coffee roasted and ground specifically for espresso machines such as Illy. Yes it's expensive but oh so tasty. If you have your own grinder, go for it, get whole beans! But make sure to do the very fine ground that's necessary to achieve a good espresso. We have yet to experiment with our grinder to test out exactly what's best. That's the next step for us.<br /><br />Lastly, as a note, if you are making more than one or two shots, use the larger grounds basket. Otherwise each shot gets more watered down as you make them. The first will be extra strong though!<br /><br />Overall, this is AWESOME for the price and we couldn't be happier with it. We use it every day.

4168,1,"EIDT. January 2013: I have now worn my first one of these out,or more accurately beat it to death. It was still working but I had gotten more out of it than I had ever hoped and it was time to retire it and buy another mostly due to operator abuse. I am on my second one for myself and I have given one as a present over a year ago which is still working well. I can't imagine morning without it.<br /><br />**ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM 2009**<br /><br />I had one of those steam pots for making espresso for years. (See my review of the Capresso Mini.) The little steamer was still working fine but I had banged it up a bit over the years. I went in search of a replacement and came across this machine.<br /><br /> I am not an espresso nut. For some people creating the perfect shot of espresso is reason to live in itself...not me. I just want a tasty cappuchino in the morning with the minimum of fuss. That is exactly what this machine delivers.<br /><br /> The quality is a bit plastic-y...but what would you expect for the price? Even so it is attractive enough that I don't mind it sitting on my kitchen counter. The foot print is a bit bigger than what I was used to with my Mini, but I do not think it is overly large when compared to other pump style espresso machines.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers I immediately removed the rubber tip from the frothing wand and stashed the single-brew porta filter in the back of the junk drawer.  doubt I'll ever use either one.<br /><br /> The coffee it produces is very good. A real step up from the old steam pot. Steaming for the milk is adequate though hardly robust. Still I have never failed to get the steaming results I wanted, so no complaints. One thing I do like is that the machine can be ready to froth milk in a few seconds without ever having to brew espresso. There are times when I like to use frothed milk in various ""Adult"" winter beverages, and now it is easy for me to to whip them up anytime.<br /><br />As has been mentioned by other reviewers there is enough room beneith the portafilter (that's ""brew basket"" to the uninitiated)to place a full sized mug...not that you would want to brew a mug full of espresso all at once, but so that you can directly brew your shot into what will be your final cup. That is the real convenience of this feature.<br /><br /> The porta filter basket is a bit strange in that it has a double bottom to it. On the inside there is a layer with very fine holes to act as a filter as one would expect,....but turn the metal filter over and on the bottom there is only one single tiny hole. I believe that this may be a crema enhancing trick, but I am not sure about that. What I do know is that I have never seen another one like it. I also know that it causes a lot of constriction to the brewing of the coffee. Perhaps it is designed to make the dosing and tamping less critical in achieving a good cup of espresso? I do not have the answer, but so far it works, so I'm not complaining.<br /><br /> If you buy this espresso maker you will also need to  get a tamper. The plastic one that comes with the machine is pretty flimsy. I got this one:<br /><br /><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/RSVP-Terry-s-Tamper/dp/B0001XRNEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">RSVP Terry's Tamper</a><br /><br />Which fits properly and does the job just fine without a lot of expense or fanfare.<br /><br />If you are thinking about trying an espresso machine, but are not sure if a fancy one is worth the expense, this is a great choice.<br /><br />UPDATE: After 9 months I haven't had a single issue with durability. I have discovered by trial and error that it is possible to over pack the filter basket (portafilter) and when that happens the pump struggles. But by now I have gotten my ""dosing"" down to a system and I always get excellent results. The leaking that other reviewers mention is caused because the pump purges into the drip tray when you are done brewing. If the drip tray isn't emptied regularly, or if it isn't seated in the base correctly it will leak water onto thte counter. The instructions tell you this. I have never had a leak problem with my unit.<br /><br />I love this machine! I wold buy another without hesitation if I had need of one, or I would give one as a gift with confidence.

4181,1,"We had purchased a $300 espresso machine, during the day to use for our family dinner before Christmas Eve last year, from a department store, by a major brand name. Had all off the recommended features, First machine made it through two cycles, both were very weak and not acceptable, then the pump failed and it peed all over the counter. Never made another cup. We went straight back to the store and got a replacement unit that only lasted most of the night. We then upgraded to a different manufacturer and paid over $400. This one made it  almost a week, before the pump failed. Took this one back and did not buy another one. This year, my wife suggested that I get a cheap unit just so she could have a latte at night. I bought this with a $30 gift certificate and took the slow freight ($9 out of pocket). You have to experiment with it a bit to get it just right to your taste, but it has been great for the espresso for the latte. We also found that it works better if you make the espresso, then put more water in and stream the milk as a separate operation. Just make sure you don't leave the coffee carafe in place or you will weaken your espresso. My wife was drinking a latte every night ($5) plus gas.

4197,1,"(Two important cleaning/maintenance tips included at the end of the review)<br /><br />I went on a trip abroad recently and whenever I ordered coffee, it was consistently absolutely terrible... however, on occasion I was actually served freshly made espresso, and it was consistently absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />I always thought that buying an espresso machine was a bit over-the-top and snobbish, but based on that experience, I decided to just break down and get one anyway.<br />I was appropriately and inevitably warned by some 'coffee connoisseurs' how you need to spend at least $500 and up, if you want even a remotely decent espresso machine.  That might have been the case at some point in the past, but in my opinion, this little machine well under $100 bucks produces some amazing results.<br /><br />I started off going really cheap - with Mr. Coffee steam driven Espresso Maker.  While the frothing ability of that one was quite wonderful and the cappuccinos were surprisingly good, the espresso lacked ""crema"" - the coffee froth on top, which is my absolute favorite part.<br />I realized that the pump-driven machine is a way to go, so I passed the first device on to my friend, who loves hot chocolate, and uses it to froth the milk.<br /><br />This machine was my second choice.<br />I still did not want to spend a fortune and hesitated a while between this one and DeLonghi (EC155), but got discouraged by the amount of the preheat/prep time on DeLonghi (about 25 mins based on most of the reviewers' accounts).<br /><br />So far I am completely delighted with this one...  it is astoundingly simple to operate and clean, the prep (preheat) time is minimal, and the espressos are JUST GREAT - there is plenty of froth (crema) on top to stimulate you visually and to satiate your taste buds as well...  and also it froths the milk fabulously.<br /><br />Yes, it does seem to leak a bit, but I was prepared for that, reading other people's reviews.  The container with the water has a hole on the bottom, through which it attaches to the machine, and the water runs through there during the brewing, so it makes sense, that some miniscule amount of that might leak in the process.<br />Not a big deal, I just wipe it off periodically.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading other reviews on here - you get quite a few helpful tips about the coffee grinding, the best coffee grounds to use, tamping, milk frothing etc ....<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like a really good espresso, and either don't want to be spending  megabucks at some *(star) bucks kind of place or don't want to plunk down couple of hundred bucks for a fancier-looking machine - then this one is a way to go.<br />Will pay for itself in a short time, and unless you are a true espresso aficionado, you will never notice the difference between your home-made espresso shot and most of the store-bought ones.<br /><br />And finally, these are two maintenance tips, that I have picked up along the way and added:<br />1.<br />The cleaning instructions do not mention this, but make sure you always wipe out the part, where the filter holder attaches to the machine (I think it is called the filter head).<br />Most of the time there are some leftover wet coffee grounds that float up from the metal filter and get stuck to the machine after each brew, and of course you won't see them unless you look from underneath.<br />And if left uncleaned after a while, the old dried-up grounds will make each new batch taste bitter and/or stale.<br />2.<br />this addendum is written Jan 19th 2010, about a year later (BTW the machine still works perfect, even though I do not use it daily, as I am trying to cut back on coffee):<br />Whenever the coffeemaker just sits around for couple of days without being used, remember first to run through a cup or two of plain water before you start the next brew, so all the metallic parts inside get chance to clean and freshen up.<br />There were several times, when I made the coffee, and had to throw it away, as it had this weird, hard to describe metallic/oily taste...  not completely toxic tasting, but just very unpleasant and WAY off.<br />Then I realized that it happened always after I have not used the thing for a while, and the problem got solved completely once I started running the water through first.",5,2009-01-28,26.0,,,Great machine for the money - both espresso and cappuccino taste excellent!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
4198,1,"My spending at coffee shops, including SBux, was way out of hand. Some days I visited 2 or 3 times. I knew I needed to save money so I started looking at home espresso/cappuccino machines. Plus, I am a big fan of organic milk and organic fair-trade coffee, so I am able to create healthier, better lattes at a fraction of the cost as coffee shops. I happened to see this one at Target on sale and bought it. At first I was cautiously happy. It seemed to work fine for my purposes, although I could never successfully make more than 2 shots of decent espresso without it leaking. After a couple weeks, it started spurting water out from the filter basket (leaking) during every brew cycle. I tried to clean everything perfectly, thinking maybe grounds were stuck somewhere. I didn't tamp too much. I used coarser grounds, but it still kept doing it. It seemed dangerous...steam and hot water spurting everywhere. And every single time you were done, you had to let all the steam out. And if you didn't put enough water in to steam the milk, you had to add more before you could continue steaming the milk. I also read the reviews where people said it exploded, and after seeing the water start spurting like crazy and leaking everywhere, I could see where that would happen. So I returned it to Target and got the pump-version of Mr. Coffee ECMP50. It was $30 more, but OMG what a difference. It is so easy to deal with. And the espresso is rich and creamy, not weak. 1 shot is enough for a big mug now! Before I had to make a sort of cafe au lait because the ""espresso"" from the ECM160 wasn't really espresso at all...it was a mix between drip coffee and espresso. For those of you out there considering this machine, please don't get it if you like good, rich espresso. It is a huge hassle. At least for me.

I use a ceramic cream pitcher to froth the milk; we have yet to splurge on a stainless steel pitcher.  Just remember to follow the cleaning instructions for the frothing wand (I followed the advice of other customers and removed the rubber tip on the frother)and just follow the directions on everything else, and you'll be in good shape.  Remember to empty the water from the drip tray after a few uses or the drip tray will overflow and leak (kind of common sense, but you know...).  Also to help those amateur frothers, after heating the milk with the frother, pull the wand out of the milk so that the tip of the wand just ""kisses"" the surface of the milk to froth.  We've made 1 inch plus thick foam this way with whole, 2 percent, 1 percent and skim milk!  Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Espresso takes some patience and love, but it's worth it!  We've now owned our machine for 7 months.",5,2010-01-17,2.0,,,LOVE IT,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
4201,1,"I use this to make a latte nearly every day. I make my family lattes sometimes too and they love them. Not only will this save you money in the long run (within a couple months if you buy coffee as much as I used to), but it is convenient because you don't have to leave your house. Of course nothing is perfect, so Cafe Barista has some negatives but only a few minor ones. My machine leaks where the portafilter gets attached in order to brew the espresso, but there is a drip tray beneath it so not a big deal. The amount of milk that is frothed I don't think is enough, so I always froth more after the espresso brews which is easily done. It can also be kind of noisy but not too bad. The tamper isn't the best (it's plastic) but does the job.<br />Overall, I think this was a smart purchase and I don't regret it.",4,2016-11-06,,,,money well spent,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

I continued to use it after the first time as I thought well maybe I didn't have everything on tight. The second time my son used it and it exploded on him and he got burned! It hadn't exploded in a week so I got lazy about watching it to see if the handle was beginning to turn on the coffee holder to the left (as that is what happens.. it blows that piece off) and was washing dishes. Low and behold.. massive steam eruption and coffee grinds all over the wall and counter. My husband heard it explode from the other room and came running wanting to know if I was okay! It is very much a safety hazard along with being a complete mess maker.  Before I purchased this I saw the youtube videos of other customers that this happened to, but I thought they just must not have had the top and the coffee container on tight. I was wrong! I make sure everything is on super tight before I brew and yet again it has exploded!! Beyond upset that I wasted $40 on this machine just 3 weeks ago when I should have just bought a pump one.

4220,1,"My wife loves lattes and cappuccinos, and this machine is acceptable for this.  The steam wand is well positioned, though it takes a long time to get going and spurts a lot of water before it gets up to speed (about a 3oz of water, honestly).  The taste of the espresso is fine, because it will be masked by your milk and flavors.<br /><br />However, I prefer to drink espresso neat, and this is where the machine falls short.  It is not brewed hot enough (or properly).  No steam passes through the grounds, instead the water is dripped like a coffee machine - this means you will not have any crema, and the espresso is short of full flavored.  The temperature can be fixed by preheating the machine (switch on the steam wand for a while), but there is still no crema, and it is still on the bitter side.  The bitterness dominates the flavor (using Lavazza Super Crema).<br /><br />I had my father come over and make a pot before I submitted this review, because he makes outstanding espresso and I wanted to make sure I gave the machine a fair chance.  It tasted better, but still didn't come close to the taste from his $60 Krups machine.<br /><br />Perhaps I got a lemon.  But I'm not gonna buy another one to find out.

Remove the milk from under the frothing tube and blow some steam for a few seconds so the tube dose not get clogged.  Continue with the coffee (counter clockwise) till it stops coming out.  Rotate back forward so all the steam is evacuated from unit.  I like to then unscrew the filler cap so when I use it again the cap is easy to open.

My theory is that you cannot foam milk that is half water.  Note also that the reservoir only holds enough water to fill the carafe so if you fill it you will not have any water left to create steam to heat the milk even if you were willing to forego the foam.

Now, with the big ole espresso machines in coffee shops I believe you can adjust the pressure settings yourself (hence the term 'pulling' espresso). This little baby isn't gonna let you do that. You just have steam, so the only variable you can really control is the ground size, and the tamping. To get smooth espresso with crema off of this machine, I needed to get fine grounds. I used preground Lavazza with some success, but using my hand-held burr grinder and Trader Joe's Espresso 5 origin blend I got it to about the same size as those grounds, perhaps a bit more fine, with better results (probably also because the beans were fresher). If you're getting excessive coffee residue/grinds in your cup it's too fine, slowly go coarser. However, the key part for me was pressing my thumb into the grounds, if it left a clean impression then that was good enough. The coffee grinds have to 'stick' to each other.<br /><br />Tamping: I used my thumb! Haha, didn't feel like waiting for the tamper to come in the mail, and honestly with this machine I'm not expecting perfect control every time so in a fatalist sense I didn't feel like it was worth it. Pat down firmly with your thumb, make the grounds as flat as possible. You can get it pretty flat and firm with just your thumb.<br /><br />Make sure the coffee machine is full when you start--I think the pressure is better that way. Haven't opened it up so I can't say how the boiler works, but fill up the tank. I use spring water from my work cooler, I imagine tap is okay too but at least try to filter it to get out some of the minerals. Descaling is a headache I don't want to deal with too often.<br /><br />I didn't heck around with letting the boiler preheat to steam and then switching around, just turned it on brew and let it go to town. I'm pretty happy with the results of thumb-tamping and flipping a switch in this photo I attached with crema!

4249,1,"I'm revising my earlier review and raising the rating from two to four stars. . Some of the problems listed below are still correct (the amount of milk still varies). But now that I've gotten used to its idiosyncrasies, I am consistently making terrific drinks every day (okay, maybe two or three drinks).<br /><br />My advice: Try it (yes, it's still messy, a bit hard to clean and somewhat inconsistent on the milk side), but for the price it DOES make great drinks.<br /><br />_______________________<br />Previous review:<br /><br />I wish I could give this a good review. Yes, it makes good espresso drinks. Sometimes.<br /><br /> It is a bit messy and the milk container is not a great design. The real problem (on two machines now) is that the flow of milk is very inconsistent. The first cup of the morning ALWAYS overflows. Calls to Mr. Coffee customer service will simply get you a brusque representative and a new machine, which will take a couple of weeks to arrive (you must return the old one to them).<br /><br />I have tried two different machines, and both had problems and had to be returned. It could be quality control, but it looks like a defective design that Mr. Coffee is willing to sell knowing that it's cheaper to keep sending replacements to unhappy customers until they fix the bugs in the next model. Also, the customer service reps could really use some lessons in patience or at least listening.

4250,1,"If you are thinking about it, if you drink your Starbucks daily, if you are tired of inconsistent results or burnt coffee, this is your solution.  The milk reservoir means no more having to clean a too low frothing wand.  The espresso scoop is very easy to load and (with the right grounds) requires minimal tamping, the drinks come out at a very *immediately* drinkable temperature, with no burnt taste.  Combine this with Lavazza Blu, whatever milk you like, and a set of syrups (we started with the 25.3oz 6 pack and honed our favorites), along with their pumps and you will save time, money, and your tongue!  I have been to Starbucks ONCE in 3 months, and it tasted gross.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Water and milk reservoirs extremely easy to fill and use.  Milk reservoir contains almost the exact amount for 2 large lattes every morning (16 oz).  If you use the quick clean cycle daily, you only need to really clean it once a week - other than that, it goes in the fridge.  No more waste.<br />- Compact - does not take up a lot of space, comes with everything needed for the machine.<br />- Temperature -- while not adjustable, we haven't needed to.  Perfect for all 3 functions, and just steamed milk for chai or hot cocoa.<br />- Sturdiness - no piece feels like it will break, we use it at least once a day , every day, and at 3 months everything works the same as day one.<br />- Push the button and go -- you get in a routine, 30 seconds attention and about a 3 minute wait gets you your daily latte, americano or cappuccino.<br />- Cost effective - we have seen a $300+ decrease in coffee expenditure over 2 months.  We drink a lot of coffee, but this saves you so much.",5,2014-03-28,2.0,,,"Make the leap, you won't be sorry","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
4251,1,"Bought it when I wanted a good single-cup brewer but couldn't find one that was any good without spending too much.  I was impecunious so I waited until this one went on sale for $25 and tried it out.  Short report:  Could not be faster or easier, has never failed me, cleans in 15 seconds, makes great coffee.  I use a variety of coffees including espresso grinds and drip grinds and they all work great.  Also the single cup aspect means no waste, which cuts way down on my coffee costs.  I figure the little darling has saved me several times its purchase price already just in coffee savings and not buying coffee bar coffees for $3-4 a cup and up.<br /><br />Also I call this the Anti-Keurig.  Why pay $140 for a machine that does the same thing and doubles your per-cup cost for the coffee grind?  Figure out the price per pound you would pay for K-cups and in about a week, you'd save enough to buy the Mr. Coffee instead and have at least $100 left over on the machine price while you are at it.  And the K-cup coffee does not, repeat not, taste better than what this little gem makes.  The K-cup is the biggest ripoff in the grocery business today, by far.<br /><br />Also ignore reports of ""exploding"" machines.  The machine cannot explode, the tank will not rupture and the cap cannot come off.  Failure to follow directions can lead to an overpressure which will release pressure through the cap safety valve, and make a noise and some steam, but there's no explosion and nothing gets hurt.  The main thing is to just remember to turn the thing off when you are done brewing.<br /><br />Caveat:  I do not like steamed milk and I do not use that feature, so I have no opinion about it.<br /><br />Note: No, it does not come with a tamper, although the little scoop works okay.  Also my old salt shaker works just fine.  Tamping is not really necessary, it just makes you feel better.  Don't overtamp, you can block the brewing cup that way and create an overpressure or delay/stop the brew.<br /><br />Note: Flavor depends on the coffee you use.  Cheapo supermarket espressos are ... okay but not wonderful.  To get wonderful, you have to use premium coffees, such as the Lavazza products that are very reasonably priced on Amazon.  Rule of thumb, the cheaper the coffee, the more bitter it will taste.  For non-bitter, spend for better coffee.  Use filtered or bottled water.  You can actually put your Yuban in this thing and get better coffee than some of the cheap espressos out there.

4276,1,"I am an experienced barista, having made lattes for the past 13 years. I bought this machine because I thought it would be a cheaper alternative to buying my lattes in cafes. I was wrong. The first time I used it, the glass caraffe exploded on me. As someone with education in both chemistry and physics, let me assure you that this is not normal. The molecules of a well-made glass container are not supposed to respond to the change in heat from putting cold water into the caraffe to fill the reservoir to espresso then filling the caraffe. This change in heat is too small to have an effect. However, if the glass is made poorly, cheaply, and without regard to surface area conditions, a smaller change in heat can affect it to the point where the glass molecules expand too quickly and the gas explodes. This often, unfortunately, happens with outsourced product-making done by people who do not plan the product to meet engineering requirements because they would rather save money. I have filed a complaint with the company and requested a recall. I repeat: this machine is dangerous and could have either killed or seriously harmed me. I was lucky to not have large glass shards in both my face and abdomen. PLEASE buy a different machine. I don't want this happening to anyone else.<br /><br />Also, the machine was not made with proper latte-making in mind. When making a latte, the espresso has to be made last, so that it can be poured into the foamed milk within 15 seconds of the shot being poured. The shots of espresso itself on this machine pour way too slowly, taking 15 seconds if not longer just to finish. The foamed milk has to be made after making the espresso, at least according to the instruction manual. At this point, once you have drawn your shot and are waiting to foam the milk, the espresso itself will have fully acidified from mixing with oxygen in the air, and your latte will be quite bitter.<br /><br />And finally, the machine has to be relieved of pressure because it is, again, cheaply made and not well-designed in terms of engineering. To do so, you must run the milk foamer to exit the pressure from the machine as steam. This can take you forever, as you will see the foamer run and run and run. If you stop running it, hoping the machine has been relieved, and then try to remove the espresso pod-holder or the reservoir cap...it again has explosive results.<br /><br />If there is any way you can save about $40 more to buy a better machine, I highly recommend it. I am currently a student again earning another degree, and can sympathize with the allure of buying a cheaper machine. Unfortunately, this truly isn't worth your safety.

4322,1,"Just to put it out there:<br />I don't drink espresso so I can't really comment on how ""authentic"" this machine makes espresso.  I love my coffee with cream and sugar, and the main reason I bought an espresso machine is to avoid the long line at Starbucks.  This is the 1st machine I own, 3rd one I tried in my life.<br /><br />Anyway, let's talk about the machine.<br /><br />What I like about it:<br />1. The water tank is easily accessible; it holds a large amount of water; I can see how much water is in the tank very easily.<br />2. The drip tray is removable, makes it super easy to clean, just because to clean it often other wise it will overflow<br />3. There's two holes on the drip try for you to lay the portafilter in (I love this feature!)<br />4. It came with both 1 shot and 2 shot basket (but I always use 2 shots when making my latte<br />5. It came with a spoon with tamper on the other side.  Not the most ideal method I know, but since I can't find a 51mm tamper, this will do for now.  The fact that it's detached from the machine already makes it so much better than some other home machines<br />6. Machines is not any louder than other ones I've tried.<br />7. Milk heats up really fast, and it's not as loud as some other machine. (though I stronly recommend moving the rubber thing on the frothing wand for easy cleaning<br /><br />What I don't like about it:<br />1. I sometimes see little water leak, but a lot of reviews say they seen the same problem<br />2. The portafilter doesn't drip completely.  my personal habit is to leave portafilter on the drip tray until it's dry then I dump it outside as compose.  not liking when I pick up the portafilter some coffee drip to my shirt/things<br />3. Cannot restart.  sometimes it's a hassle to make more than one cup of espresso at a time, the mahines takes just a long to warm up for later cups as for first cups.<br />4. basket is not a common size; I am having very hard time finding a right size tamper...<br /><br />That's pretty much it.

4327,1,"I received this as a Christmas gift (purchased at Target), after reviewing the products online to let my in-laws know which one I wanted. I had a Mr. Coffee Cappuccino/Espresso Maker about 12 years ago that was purchased at Wal-mart and the carafe broke (at that time it wasn't easy to just find that sort of stuff online so I threw out the whole machine). This one is very similar to the one I had before, but I think it works more powerfully.<br />Pros-brews a great cappuccino with Starbucks Decaf Espresso beans/grind.<br />-powerful frother.<br />-overall I like it a lot.<br /><br />Cons-takes a long time to clean.<br />-the screw cap for the water reservoir is an awkard shape and finish making it difficult to ensure it is screwed on properly or tightly until water starts spewing out the top (only happened the first time-I've been careful ever since).<br />-ditto for shape and texture of power/brew/steam knob; just difficult to grip and turn.<br />-labels on carafe are only on one side, so handle must be turned to the right to know when to stop brewing; I prefer the handle on the left because it is awkward for me to be on the right (and I'm right-handed).<br />-As all the other reviews state: order a 20 oz. frothing pitcher as a minimum; I tried using a measuring 4C. measuring cup and it spewed milk all over my counter and kitchen. I froth 4 oz. of milk in the 20 oz. pitcher and make only a little mess now. I am still no pro at frothing-I end up with a lot of hot milk and a few bubbles after the ""frothing"" process-looks like someone blowing huge bubbles in your milk-is done.<br />-SUPER ANNOYING: it has an 8"" power cord. What is up with that? It is hard to reach on a deep counter and it makes a huge mess all over my back-splash while frothing/cleaning. Since I am an amateur, I have to turn the machine this way and that in order to froth and it makes a mess because I tip the entire machine over, almost get burned, etc. Going to have to find a place on my counter where I can place it and use an extension cord.<br /><br />Overall-a great purchase and value for not having to stop at Starbucks for a real cappuccino (time and expense). I am just nit-picky about the little things. I also wish I had a magic button to clean it all up when my coffee is brewed so I can sit and enjoy my coffee-sometimes stopping at Starbucks is enticing just so I don't have to clean up the mess.",4,2012-01-24,,,,Great for a home-made cappuccino!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

4331,1,"I would like to preface this review by stating that I'm a pretty serious coffee snob (BUT WAIT!!!  That doesn't mean I hated the product).  I work as a barista at a very high end gourmet coffee shop that pays a fanatical attention to detail.  I wanted to purchase an espresso machine for my home, and I ventured into my local target and walked out with this one.  While it is pretty much impossible for a small, consumer-level espresso machine to keep up with the larger professional models, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of both the espresso and steam wand.<br /><br />The espresso actually had  a decent amount of creme (the layer of foam laying over the liquid in an espresso shot), which you don't get in a lot of low end espresso machines, mostly because a lot of the smaller machines can't control the pressure going into the espresso grinds, but this one seems to do a pretty good job.  I would recommend warming the machine up a bit before you make your drink.  The keys to good espresso temp control and attention to both the grind of the espresso and the way it is situated in the puck, so if you get the machine hot before you brew and make sure that you take care in packing and tamping the espresso into the puck, it will go a long way.<br /><br />For steaming the milk, the directions in the manual are actually pretty decent.  The wand is fairly good, its not as powerful as the larger espresso machines, but for the size and cost it's actually quite good.  Turn the steam wand on for a second or two, then turn it off, then insert the wand into your milk and start steaming.  Otherwise the wand (as with all other espresso machines) will discharge cold water into your drink.  Also, run the wand for a second or two after you finish steaming, this clears the milk out of the tip of the wand, so it won't wander back into the boiler.<br /><br />If you people aren't yet sick of listening to me talk, I would recommend doing some youtube surfing and watching some videos on milk steaming and also on espresso grinding and tamping.  It will help a lot.  If you find that you are getting really large bubbles in your milk, you are probably trying to ""stretch"" the milk too quickly, so settle the steam wand further into the milk.  You want to the wand to ""chirp"" every couple of seconds, that will get you a proportional amount of foam for a latte or cappuccino.  Check out videos by David Schomer (ignore the fact that he looks like the kid you used to beat up in highschool, he actually knows his coffee pretty well), and once you get the foam down, check out some latte art videos and try to play with that.  It's fun. If you would like to know more about the technique and things of that sort, I've just decided to start a blog, so go look for it.<br /><br />To recap:<br /><br />Espresso machine is really quite good for the money.<br /><br />hope this helps!",4,2011-01-28,10.0,,,Actually pretty decent for the money,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

4337,1,"I was hoping for a much better taste, but the hot water passes through some plastic parts in the machine that do leave some slight plastic flavor on your espresso. Also, when you brew two shots at the same time, the two holes will pour the coffee unevenly, so it's annoying that you can't have both mugs with exactly the same amount of coffee. Moreover, the machine vibrates when brewing, so your mugs will move enough to get the espresso all spilled over the drip tray if you're not holding them. This wouldn't happen if they had designed a larger distance between the holes. Moreover, the plastic clip attached to the brew basket is so poorly designed that it gets stuck with the upper part of the machine, and you have to really force it to turn it to the right before brewing.

Easy to use and it makes some pretty good espresso!<br /><br />When using the beans from our local coffee shop, it's almost as good as their best barista can make on their specialized italian machine, and better than the three other baristas that work there - probably because they just don't know how to tamp the beans or adjust the grind. Moral of the story: a lousy barista can screw up the work of even a great machine.<br /><br />But if I use my own preferred blend of beans, I find the coffee is way better than any of the shops in town.

4384,1,"Update: After 5 Days of Use<br /><br />The machine is still a good low cost espresso machine and I retain the 4 stars.  However, I have to take back the fact that it's a fantastic coffee machine.  If you use the specified amount of beans with the water, it makes a great espresso.  However, trying to use it as a coffee machine by adding more water is not so good.  The problem lies in the the fact that the pressurized steam water literally shoots like a jet rocket half way through.  This cause the water to essentially pass through the grind that's already been drained of flavor super heated, adding a cigarette/ashe taste to the robust inital drain.  I wasn't expecting so much pressure from the machine.  Expensive pump based machines aren't like this and can be used as a coffee like machine.  I'll just use it as an espresso machine, as it was meant to be.  My Mr Coffee 4 cup coffee machine, which is discontinued i think, still is the best coffee machine.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />I'm a very picky coffee drinker, who is also budget conscious.  I've gone through years of evolution in my coffee brewing techniques to try to brew the best tasting coffee at the lowest price.  My current setup is a 4 cup Mr Coffee coffee maker with a Krups burr grinder.  Previously, I used to use a Krups coffee maker with a cone filter and the typical low end spinning blade grinder.  I was reasonably satisfied with the current setup, but wanted a stronger punch to the coffee flavor, closer to an espresso.  The Mr Coffee coffee machine is the best coffee maker, because it had a water drip that wasn't just a one hole in the center like 99% of the coffee makers, but had multiple drip holes that truelly spread the water over much of the beans.  This extracted the maximum flavor from the coffee beans.  However, I still felt that a hotter water like steam and more concentrated wetting of all the beans would bring out the maximum flavor.  This is where Mr Coffee ECM160 espresso machine came into the picture.  Because the water comes down as super heated steam level into a tiny sealed container spread over the entire surface area, the maximum flavor extraction is achieved.  This makes a fantastic strong flavor coffee with equal amount of beans as my previous coffee machine, which means I can use even less beans and still make a better tasting coffee.  I can put in 2 servings worth of coffee grind with 4 servings of water (espresso), which equates to about 2 cups of coffee, and it still taste better and stronger then when i used twice the amount of beans in a regular coffee machine.  If your used to using a coffee filter so u don't get the fine coffee grinds, you will initially be dissapointed with the murky trasparency of the coffee.  However, the way to get around this is use a metal mesh Krups cone filter, as a filter to pour the coffee into your mug or cup.  This removes any large grinds and you end up with a fantastic coffee with incredibly strong robust flavor.  As far as making an espresso, all you need to do is just use less water.  It does create that mild foam that most expensive espresso machine make, but not as good.  But the flavor is almost identical to a $200 espresso machine I've used in the past at work.  I can't speak for the foaming stick, cuz I don't make cappucinos.<br /><br />Now, why only 4 stars ?<br />Well, the huge power on off wheel on the left is an overkill, and takes up alot of space.  They could have just had 1 on/off switch for brewing and 1 button for the foaming stick.  As mentioned by another reviewer, the aluminum molded water container/heating element could be health issue if it ever degrades over time.  IMO, it will be fine as long as u follow the direction to NOT open the pressure lid until the machine has fully cooled off.  This is to prevent the water drying up inside the aluminum holding tank while it's super hot, causing the minerals to deposit and break down the aluminum from both heat, minerals, and chemicals.<br /><br />It also does not come with a tamper, and the plastic scooper it comes has an inadequate tiny flat bottom that your supposed to use as tamper.  It does not fit properly to tamper down the coffee without making a mess.  You do need to use a real tamper or, if you don't want to buy a tamper, you can use anything round that is flat and large enough to press down the coffee grind uniformly.  A 49 mm tamper fits perfectly, as it is large enough for full 4 servings of grind and small enough to go lower to press down 2 servings of grind.<br /><br />It doesn't come with a foaming container, but I didn't expect it to.  However, I think it should have come with atleast a cheap plastic tamper that fits.<br /><br />Now the bonus of using this machine over a regular coffee machine, is that you don't have to buy coffee filters AND you don't have to use those white cholorinated 4 cup coffee filters.  That means your not drinking any more chlorine or any chemicals that came from the paper.  A health benefit.<br /><br />Other then that, for the price of $37, it's a great deal.  It makes the best coffee u could possibly make and will save you on beans to pay for itself over time.",4,2011-02-02,,True,,Good Low End Espresso Machine,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
4385,1,"DISCLAIMER:<br />1. I have never owned another espresso machine.<br />2. I have been using this machine consistently for about a month.<br />--<br />DETAILS:<br />I purchased this machine because years of experience with products in general has taught me that one should go cheap on the first go and then when one has some level of expertise with the medium (be it coffee or cooking or computers or musical instruments)--THEN go spend the ""bigger bucks"" for something which you can utilize with some acumen.<br /><br />The first few times you will probably fail to tamp right and get either a too-bitter slow brew or a too-weak fast brew; but if you're that skilled as a barrista you wouldn't be mucking about with this type of machine anyway!<br /><br />The build quality seems acceptable for what is a truly entry-level device.  The carafe, however, seemed frail even when I first handled it; and the frailty was proven when the other day it fell a few inches and shattered on a granite surface.  Luckily I have thick-bottomed glass tumblers which serve as an adequate stand-in; measuring water by eye is easy enough anyway.<br />--<br />PROS:<br />* CHEAP.<br />* Quick and easy setup (3-5 minutes to create a latte; parts are pretty idiot-proof in handling).<br />* Easy cleanup (all parts removable, and the wand is easily wiped clean with a coarse brush when the plastic sleeve is removed.<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Treat gently as the parts are as fragile as the price suggests!<br />--<br />CONCLUSION:<br />Definitely worth it as a ""my first espresso machine"" as at this price point you really can't go wrong and it's too simple to screw up too easily.<br /><br />**********<br />EDIT<br />**********<br />I've upped it a star.

This machine was a huge upgrade over my old (steam driven) mr. coffee espresso machine.  The pump seems pretty strong.  It does create a nice crema.  The steam feature on the machine starts off kind of weak, but after about 30 seconds of frothing it seems to pick up so I'm not sure if it's taking a while to actually heat up enough or what.  Like a few people said on here, my machine did not come with the scoop/tamper that it was supposed to come with.  I was a little disappointed with that but I already have one of those double sided tampers so no big deal.  I think I will contact the vendor to find out if they can send me one though.<br /><br />Something that I found kind of odd is while frothing you can hear a clanking or thumping coming from the back every second or so.  I think this is just a water pump but I didn't read anywhere that it's supposed to do that.  I'm guessing it's fine since it still produces steam.<br /><br />Something that is kind of annoying is when you remove the porta-filter after pulling a shot it is still fairly wet, almost soupy sometimes.  I'm used to having a nice dry puck I can knock out, but on this machine I have to scoop it out with a spoon.  A little tedious if you're trying to pull multiple shots, no big deal if you're only doing one.<br /><br />Time will tell how long this machine lasts but so far I've made ~ 10 shots on it, so its well on it's way to paying for itself.",4,2012-09-25,,True,,good so far,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

4426,1,"Several days I spent reviewing 'all in one' espresso machines, and there's a lot to filter through (get it? ah my jokes are too corny anyhow).  After doing a heavy amount of research I was satisfied with this choice.  Took me a few weeks to pull the trigger, but I couldn't be happier that I did.  I was addicted to kwik trip lattes, Starbucks lattes, anyplace that has a latte you name it.  I'm quite positive this has already paid for itself by not having to go to all those places.<br /><br />But let's talk more about the thing!<br />It's kind of big but it has its own dedicated spot in my kitchen.  It's nice enough to be left out and not have to store away in a cabinet.  What I REALLY like about it is that it's pretty much an all in one system without the thousand dollars plus all in one cost.  I push one button and all the magic happens, and it's quite entertaining to watch the espresso cascade through the milk and create separate layers.  I also like that I can take the milk and store it in my fridge.  I've done some temperature tests and only noticed a 5-degree increase after making a double latte before I put it back in the fridge.  This is nice as you would think to be so close to all that heat it would be a much bigger temperature fluctuation.  Just make sure you put the blasted spout up otherwise you'll have a fun time cleaning up a giant mess of milk.  I really wish there was some sort of sensor that assisted with this issue as I guess I'm stupider than I thought when it comes to lifting that lever.<br /><br />For anyone who wanted to know, it fits a full-sized pint glass underneath it if you remove the drip tray.  It is a tight fit as you will have to angle the pint glass to slide it in but I use pint glasses for my large lattes consistently.  The latte puts out almost double the amount of milk that the cappicino does.  I think all single servings should be able to fit in your regular sized coffee mug.<br /><br />Another aspect I really like is the cleaning aspect.  Just hold the top button for the coffee grind connector (w/e you call it) to get cleaned and hold the bottom button for the milk frother to get cleaned... that's pretty simple!  I did notice that the milk froth cleaner doesn't get all the milk out of the metal tube, but since it slides right off and is pretty easy to clean it's not that big of a deal to me.<br /><br />So ultimately how does this compare to all the places I regularly go to?  It's spot on.  Sure it's not the sugar loaded 1500 calorie Starbucks grade latte, but as far as the espresso taste goes it's very close.  I actually prefer not adding any sugar or other diabetes contributing nonsense half these latte makers add and find this is a much healthier option for me as well.<br /><br />If you enjoyed my review please like it.

Never wash the portafilter in the dishwashing machine.  Just don't do it.  It will lose the nice shine because it is aluminum.  (yes, again I know from experience).<br /><br />4.

4428,1,"I just ordered our second one of these.  We purchased the identical model almost 10 years ago and it finally died.  We make a full batch of espresso every single morning for homemade lattes with the occasional second round (if we have guests or want an early afternoon bonus latte on the weekends).  The device is simple.  Because there aren't any fancy options or electronic buttons, there are less possible things that can break on it, which is a plus for me.  Since we make two lattes every morning (= 4 shots of espresso total, or one full carafe) I find it more efficient to microwave the milk instead of using the built in steamer/frother.  As a former barista, the froth on top was fun, but not worth the effort at home.<br /><br />In the last ten years, we have had to purchase a replacement carafe once because the original was accidentally set down too hard on the counter and shattered.<br /><br />Update 7/11/15:  Moving from 5 to 2 stars.  The first one we order years ago was WONDERFUL.  Unfortunately, when it finally died, the replacement leaked all over.  When brewing, water would drip from the top and get all over the counter.  Clearly it was defective.  We contacted Mr. Coffee directly to let them know about the issue.  They rushed a replacement to our house (thanks!) and it worked well at first.  After 1-2 months of daily use, this &#34;leakage&#34; problem is re-occuring with increasing frequency.  While this USED to be a quality-made product that stood the test of time, I'm not going to give them another shot.  Sad.<br /><br />Update 6/5/16: Don't buy this.  10 years ago this was an awesome machine.  I'm now on #5 because I refused to believe that the quality had dropped that much and I wanted to leverage all of the spare accessories that I'd accumulated.  Go with something else.

4429,1,"*Update*: Still like this machine but just beware that the screws in the water tank rust. The rust crumbles off and falls onto a ledge inside the water tank, not directly into the water, but it's possible little pieces of rust can tumble into the water.<br /><br />This machine is a great value for the quality of espresso you get out of it. The portafilter (the thing that holds the coffee) is pressurized (read up on pressurized vs non-pressurized portafilters), which is the key to why this is a safe beginner machine. A pressurized portafilter will not release coffee until enough pressure has built up within the basket, extracting dense flavor, the key to a good espresso. Non-pressurized portafilters rely on the fine grain of espresso ground coffee being tightly compacted into the basket (called tamping) to provide a similar resistance (fyi, espresso snobs demand a non-pressurized basket supposedly because it gives more control over the extraction process). This machine is designed to work better with coarser regular ground coffee (for drip machines), but I HIGHLY recommend you do not do that. Buy a burr grinder and find a grind somewhere between coarser filter coffee and very fine espresso coffee that you like best. Very fine espresso coffee will clog in this machine's portafilter, which is actually good because you won't have to buy a $500 coffee grinder in order to get the right size grind (by the way, very fine coffee works best in non-pressurized portafilters, which the snobs like). Another complaint about pressurized baskets is that the crema can be watery, flavorless, and dissipates quickly because it's basically water bubbles. For some reason, this machine makes great oily crema that is creamy and long-lasting. I love making Americanos with this machine for this reason (it creates a creamy cup of coffee much different than a regular cup of coffee). Milk steamer is adequate, but I suggest beginners watch youtube videos on how to steam milk properly. Buy a small milk pitcher because the spout is short (I use a 12 oz bought on amazon).

4430,1,"Great machine for the price.  Steaming arm actually works on this generation.  A few notes: 1. Take off and throw away the rubber/plastic thing on the steaming wand.  2.  prime the steaming wand; a good squirt of water comes out first; you don't want that in your milk!!.  3. prime the brew head as well for a few secs--twice; some cold water will get in your coffee if you don't.  4. after you're done brewing and have removed the portafilter, rinse the brewhead by just priming it for a couple secs--twice.  This will get any coffee grounds off the &#34;showerhead.&#34;  5.  ALWAYS brew into clear shot glasses; 25-30 secs MAX.  If you're not getting two oz.  of espresso by 30 secs, your grind is too fine or too packed.  Less than 25 secs???  Grind finer or pack more for good strong shots.  A simple digital kitchen timer is all you need.  Also, if you don't know what a good shot looks like; heart, body, crema, ask a Barista at your Local GOOD Coffeehouse; not Starbucks.  They don't even make their own shots!! THIS CANNOT BE OVER-EMPHASIZED:  Don't run shots for volume; run for time.

Now that I've grown up quite a bit and have a normal, M-F 9 to 5 kind of job with a commute and all the fun stuff that comes with it, I'm willing to sacrifice my coffee morals for convenience but definitely not taste. I still grind my own beans because that's really the only way to do it in my opinion. I'n not saying it's the perfect machine but unless your willing to spend a lot more money on a &#34;pro-sumer&#34; machine(a professional grade machine but only has one head for brewing) then this is a great option. I recently got it on Prime Day when there was a lightning deal on it. I'd been looking into buying a new one that was more powerful than my old machine and this was a great fit. Overall, if you're looking for a good machine to save some money on your morning coffee and save some time before your commute, this is a wonderful option.<br /><br />****Note: Please remember to properly clean and maintain the machine! Run the cleaning cycle after every use. Always, always, always use filtered water, never tap. There are too may minerals in tap and it will mess up your machine very quickly. Be sure to descale your machine at the very least once a month depending on usage.  They sell excellent and easy to use descaling products on amazon as well.****<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It has a pump that's powerful enough to steam milk quickly and thoroughly and the machine doesn't overheat (I've had this issue before with different brand)<br />-The water reservoir holds enough for several drinks. I didn't track it closely but I think I made about 8-10 drinks before running low on water<br />-The milk reservoir holds enough milk to make two 15oz drinks and then some if you want a little extra<br />-The controls are easy enough to use. One quick read through on the instructions and I was set<br />-The machine has a cleaning setting for the steaming wand. It's still very important to go through and descale the machine and wash everything properly but that setting is really helpful if you know you'll be using it later in the day as well<br />-I can fit a 16oz size coffee mug in it<br />-You can adjust the amount of foam in your drink. So if you want a latte a little dry, you can definitely get that.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />-Volume. I wouldn't say it's a loud machine by any stretch, but it's not exactly quiet when steaming milk. But if you've ever used an espresso machine or been around one, you know that's not the quiet part of making a drink anyways<br />-The filter basket in the porta-filter twist locks into place. Not really an issue but it can get a little annoying when it spins as you're trying to tamp espresso<br /><br />Cons:<br />-If your only goal is to get beautiful, coffee shop style latte art, this is not the machine for you. It's practical, not artsy. It makes a darn good latte or cappuccino but it doesn't get frilly. I knew what I was getting so that wasn't an issue for me at all.<br />-I can't fit a tall, travel tumbler in it<br />- If you want a &#34;no-foam&#34; latte, you won't be getting that. The machine always produces foam. This is not an issue for me but I realize it may be for some people. It's easy enough to just scoop the foam off the top. In reality, anytime you steam milk your're going to get foam. Whenever you order a &#34;no-foam&#34; latte at a coffee shop, the foam is still there the barista just has to use a spoon to hold the foam back from pouring into your cup.",5,2017-07-16,33.0,True,,Great machine at a good price.

4454,1,"First off, I am in no way a coffee snob. I don't even like coffee. I love cappuccinos from Panera Bread though. I might have one once a week or so.<br />We bought ours from Target for $59 on sale. I read all the reviews and figured it would be the easier return then shipping back to Amazon. My worries were for nothing! We've had this for 2 months now, it gets used almost daily- my cappuccino habit has become much more now that I don't have to go out and buy them. This machine is very easy to operate, just a few touches of a button and a flick of a switch. You will need to purchase a small frothing pitcher and a coffee grinder. I bought both from Amazon for under [...] for both. I grind my beans before making the cappuccino. I have no problems at all with the flow. A ""regular"" size coffee mug fits under the spouts fine. I always use the 2 serving ""basket"" for a normal coffee cup, which I fill maybe 1/2 inch from the bottom with the coffee/espresso. I use flavored syrups from Torani which are amazing- [...] is phenomenal for prices and shipping of them. ( I searched everywhere and their prices and shipping speed can't be beat) I have had absolutely no issue with leaking at all. You do need to be sure to empty the drip tray after each use, that solves that problem. I leave the water tank in and fill as needed with a pitcher of water.<br />The only cons I can think of are that I wish the streaming wand was a tad longer. I have burnt my hand once or twice until I got the hang of it and it can be noisy at first, it doesn't last long.<br />Also the fact that my coffee habit has shot up tremendously! It's so nice to stay in nice warm jammies and not have to drive to get a cappuccino when I want one.<br />The taper works fine for me, it's not heavy duty. But it does the job and packs the espresso down fine. Maintenance has simply been to wipe down the steam wand immediately after each use and to wipe off the coffee grounds from where the coffee comes down. The tray on top of the maker is excellent for storing everything. I am thrilled with this cappuccino maker.<br />I'd buy another in a heartbeat.",5,2011-01-24,,,,"Saves me a lot of money, works fantastic","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

The ECM20 had weak plastic covering the frothing tip and it broke easily within the first couple weeks.  Which when broken, makes it a bit difficult to froth milk without it.  The same went with the glass carafe lid.  The plastic tabs that held it onto the carafe broke after a month of removing it in order to clean it.  The ECM250 improved by shortening the length of the frothing tip and it never broke since I bought it, but still had the issue of the plastic tabs on the carafe lid breaking. Another drawback for the ECM250 was the print of the steam/off/brew functions directly on the control knob so that your fingers would actually buff it off after so long.  I've had the 2 ECM250's over the past 5+ years and that was the only problem I had with it.  Just that the last one I owned had the plastic Filter basket handle break from the inside.  I noticed the screw had also become rusty over the couple years of use. I'm sure it would have lasted longer if the handle was made differently.<br /><br />As for this ECM160, I like what's continued to be improved on.  The flat top next to the reservoir cap is an awesome design function to keep the measuring cup and the carafe organized and clean away from the filter basket so any left over water passing thru the coffee as the machine is cooling won't get in your carafe.  The wider, open base for the carafe doesn't feel so constricting.  The silver band around the top is a nice aesthetic addition to make the machine look like one you would see at a cafe or Starbucks.<br /><br />Just that there is where the problems begin.  The control knob on the left side of the machine isn't as easy as the previous models were to turn.  The ECM250 had that extra bit of plastic material on top to grab onto so you could hold the machine as you turned the knob.  It may have been just a design just to distinguish the model, but it gave functionality to the form.  The metal band on the ECM160 wraps around the front of this machine gets hot... REALLY hot when you're brewing your coffee.  The only way I've had to hold anywhere on the machine is the reservoir cap so that I can turn the control knob from brew to steam so I can froth my milk.<br /><br />Which brings me to another issue of grip.  The ECM160 knob and reservoir lid are a bit of a design weakness for this model.  The knob and lid edges are softly rounded which makes gripping it difficult.  The way control knob is installed on the machine requires people to either grip it with the palm of their hand or turning your wrist backwards in order to grip it.  If they had kept the squared grip like the ECM250 for the reservoir and the round control knob, I wouldn't have any problems with using it.  The round control knob didn't require me to turn my wrist at all in trying to grip onto it.  It would have been better if I could use just my fingers and not my entire hand to turn, like I used to with the ECM250. At least it wasn't like the ECM20, it's reservoir lid was the shape of an airplane propeller nozzle.  It was very hard to grip without using a paper towel to screw on or off.<br /><br />Despite those flaws, the ECM160 does brew a good cup of cappuccino.  Just that if anyone was getting their first machine to make their espresso/cappuccinos, I'd try to get them to find the ECM250 and use that model instead of this one.  It's just those functionality issues with the machine that make all the difference in the long run.",3,2011-09-17,,,,"Brews a good cup, but it has issues.","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
4456,1,"This is our first espresso machine and I too read a lot of reviews to make up my mind. The reviews earlier on this page by L. Hamilton (Chattanooga, TN USA) and by M. Krueger (Austin, TX) were very helpful. Thanks for being so detailed and honest. After reading theirs and a few more from other people I decided to buy this model. I'm happy I did. The espresso machine does indeed work great.<br /><br />My husband and I both use the machine for different reasons: he loves espresso and I love (a lot of) frothed milk in my coffee.<br /><br />The espresso: turns out very nice with a creamy top - perfect. We buy our espresso in the supermarket. Some brands are even cheaper than regular ground coffee.<br /><br />The frothing: I had to get used to the frothing tube. Since this model does not come with a frothing pitcher I had to search for that first and then ended up buying this one:<br /><br />Krups stainless steel frothing pitcher, 12oz.<br />ASIN: B000TVDEE4<br /><br />I bought this frothing pitcher because it is not too tall for the frothing tube, but still wide enough to get a good amount of milk in it. Don't fill the frothing pitcher to the top - just about 1/3 would be enough - the liquid grows as you steam it it. Yes, it took indeed a few times to get used to making the ""perfect"" froth, I admit. But now I enjoy a great cup of coffee with a one inch topping of creamy frothed milk - yummy!<br /><br />Note: In the review by K. Krueger he suggested to take the frothing tube CAP off (to avoid build-up of bacteria). Please do not follow his advice. I did, but the difference in noise the tube makes without the cap was amazing. I thought that a plane taking off next to my house couldn't be any noisier. So, please, leave the black frothing tube cap on and simply slide it off after you frothed the milk to clean the entire frothing tube and the cap. Your ears will thank you for it ;)<br /><br />There were two things I would like to point out:<br /><br />1- Since we never had an espresso machine we were a little surprised by the noise it makes. Certainly more than a little hissing of a coffee maker. The rhythmic ""knocking"" while steaming milk at least helps me count to 45 or so it takes to froth it :)<br /><br />2- My husband uses one of Bodum's double-wall Thermo Glasses - it is very light. When making espresso the machine trembles a bit and the glass underneath the brew basket starts to dance away from the middle. Keep an eye on your cup to find out if it stays in place.<br /><br />Mr. Hamilton mentions in his CONS that he notices regularly a small leak. On the Quick Start Instructions it reads:""Note: Once the brew (or froth) cycle is completed, steam will be released from beneath the drip tray to remove any remaining water from the heater."" It may help if you empty the drip tray right after using the machine?<br /><br />Overall: great machine - super value - no regrets.",5,2009-10-20,,,,Works nice - love the frothing,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

I've owned this Espresso Maker for 6 months and I've brewed well over 100 drinks. Here are some things to consider before making your decision:<br />- The quality of drinks is very good for homemade. Certainly not the world's best but I've noticed that my homemade drinks are better than some restaurants and coffee shops. That's a proud feeling!<br />- The grind size of the espresso/coffee bean is extremely important. I use Cafe La Llava - quality/price it's perfect.<br />- It takes 2-3 minutes for the machine to heat up. Once it's heated you can use multiple times.<br />- The crucible needs to be cleaned and refilled after each use.<br />- Cleaning the appliance itself, not the crucible and reservoir attachments, is bothersome. Splash-back from the espresso and froth will occur, and it will seep into the cracks of the appliance's plastic exterior.<br />- You can heat water through this machine for tea. Although it's not very hot.<br /><br />When I look at time and money this appliance has paid for itself. I can have an espresso, cappuccino, or latte in minutes for pennies. Before I would walk or drive to a shop, wait in line, and spend dollars for similar quality. So yes, I am happy with my investment, but I will eventually upgrade for a few reasons:<br />- While the quality is good, it's not amazing. I've spent time in Europe and the quality of their coffee is far superior and I believe some of that has to do with the espresso machine.<br />- I want an automatic and self-cleaning espresso machine<br />- Call me shallow but the allure of owning a professional appliance",5,2014-03-23,2.0,True,,Great investment,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

And there is nothing to say that the expensive ones will even last that long. It does make a good, strong cup of coffee, and that is its major strength. It is also easy to operate and keep clean. The frother is quite effective. Overall, I like the simplicity of the design. There are lots of extra, unnecessary parts to fuss with. This is the third one of this model that I've had.<br /><br />There are, however, several negatives. First, this is not a real espresso machine. It uses steam, not pressure, and it will not give you any real crema. The selector knob can be a bit difficult to grasp if it's dry and/or you have dry hands. The lid to the carafe becomes increasingly loose as the tabs designed to hold it in place gradually give way. I had to glue rubber surface savers onto it to keep the lid from falling off. The carafe lip is poorly designed and will dribble if you aren't careful.<br /><br />The plastic &#34;keeper&#34; for the coffee basket won't last. I prefer to put a little duck tape around the inside basket and have it stick in the holder on its own.<br /><br />Finally, the selector knob on my first machine broke after about eleven months of use, and my replacement machine has just died due to the same problem. So, it's lasted a bit over a year and a half, and that is probably not too bad, but I'm thinking of moving up to something different to see if I can still get a reasonably inexpensive machine that will make good coffee.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Good coffee at a low price.",4,2011-08-06,,True,,Great Price But Not A Real Espresso Machine and Not So Durable,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

It makes lattes that are even better than my current pump machine, which I paid nearly $200 for. (Probably because I haven't mastered the technique of making the latte with the smaller shots of real espresso from the pump machine).<br /><br />This espresso machine puts out a good deal of strong coffee. It is not technically espresso, which requires higher pressure than a steam powered machine can muster.  So I agree with the reviewer who says that if you're looking only for espresso shots, you don't want to go with this machine.  It will not give you that amazing taste that comes only from a proper shot of espresso pulled from a pump machine that is at much higher pressure.<br /><br />But if you're looking for a machine only for lattes, cappuccinos, and other such drinks, this is definitely worth the money. (Currently $29! What a deal!)<br /><br />I give it 4 stars not because it is 4 stars when considered beside other espresso machines in the market. My standard, rather, is that it is an amazing purchase for the price and will definitely fill the craving for those who are putting all the money into Starbucks and want to cut back on this costly, overpriced habit.<br /><br />I recommend also investing in a 6 pack of Torani chocolate syrup, which is what you need to make a delicious mocha latte. You can also get it in other flavors.  This machine will also be more than sufficient to make a frappuccino.  What I do with frapps is to freeze the espresso, put a little more ice in the blender with the frozen espresso (you may not even need more ice given how much ""espresso"" is produced with this machine which, as I said, is far more than with a pump machine), some milk, and then some Torani syrup.

4488,1,"I'm a beginner when it comes to making espressos, cappuccinos lattes and what not and this thing fit the bill entirely. Depending on how you tamp your grounds and how fresh your beans are the crema comes out really nice. On a bad pull you'll get two black spots with no crema, but more often than not the whole entire top is covered in crema. I read about this false crema thing and I'm pretty sure this thing doesn't have it. I used a Cuisinart machine a few times and the ""crema"" vanishes after about 10 minutes. For this machine I've accidentally left a cup of foam out over night and it's still there in the morning. I don't know what the literature says but I'm pretty sure the stuff that sticks around is actually crema.<br /><br />This machine does take a little getting used to. I've read some reviews where people are having trouble with the steam wand. This thing is not a professional espresso maker you can't just turn on the steam and expect steam to come out. You need to tell the machine you want to steam and each and ever time. I learned that the best way to do it is to hit the button wait for it to go solid, pour the milk, put the tip of the wand into the milk, turn on the steam, and start texturing. When I'm done turn off the steam (important), take out the milk, turn the steam on for a second to clear it out. The second time you turn on the steamer you'll only be able to for a few seconds before it starts spitting. It's really just to clean it anyways and a few seconds is plenty.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. It's big enough that you can fit mugs under the group head AND the steam wand<br />2. Good crema (I think...)!<br />3. It's pretty quick tbh less than a minute to brew, less than a minute to steam.<br />3. Good price.<br /><br />My only complaints<br /><br />1. You can't buy replacements (that I could find) for the portafilter.<br />2. The steam wand is pretty wimpy.<br />3. It's noisy<br />4. Personally I think it's an ugly looking machine, but function over form right?<br /><br />My advice to you if you decide to get this machine. Is first take off that stupid rubber thing over the steam wand it's useless and just makes a bunch of bubbles. The second thing look up videos on how to texture milk, this thing can do it with a bit of practice. Third thing is when the light stops flashing and goes to solid for the steam you can't turn it off anymore you need to finish steaming.

I have never made one before, but read up on it (including some of these reviews) and had no problem pulling off my very first try! Not to mention, with the money we saved by not buying a pricier model (we were also considering the Cuisinart) we decided to buy a burr mill. I know things will only get better from here! I do recommend two things: as other reviewers have said, read the directions! That way when all the lights start blinking or its not working the way it should, you'll know why! (like I did the first time I used it!) and take some time to read other reviews. They will give you good tips on how to make a good espresso, especially if you've never done it before! I also recommend buying from Amazon. I have read other reviews where they purchased the item from a local store so they would have the option of returning it, but Amazon is very good about returns. Besides, the prices are always lower, add on the super saver shipping, and in my case, there was no tax.

4517,1,"I had a ""Mr. Coffee BVMC-EL1 Cafe Latte"" maker the fall of 2011 and had a lot of fun making the different drinks. But it wasn't near as nice as this one is. For making the milk frothy it used a funky whisk like thing run by a little motor in the lid for the little coffee pot. It worked great, for a while. But the little motor that made the milk foamy wasn't big enough or powerful enough to last very long. Using it 2 or 3 times a day it quit working after only 3 months. With the way this one, the ""Mr. Coffee BVMC-ECMP1000 Café Barista Espresso Maker"" does the milk it should last for a long time.<br />I also like the way I don't have to worry about how much water to put in the tank or how much milk to put in its little tank either. The machine automatically uses the same amount every time. And if I want a little more water to my Latte or Cappuccino I only need to press the Espresso button and it will give it another shot of hot water.<br />On the little tank for the milk there's a little knob that you use to select Latte on one side or Cappuccino on the other. With it set to Latte the milk comes out nice and hot and lightly foamed. On Cappuccino the milk is frothier or more aerated than on Latte. You can adjust just how foamy or frothy you want your milk, from lightly foamy (Latte setting) to very foamy with lots of bubbles (Cappuccino setting) just by where you set the knob. It's just like turning the volume knob on a radio.<br /><br />For the amounts that it brews, a Cappuccino single serving is a little over ½ cup (150ML). A double serving is a little under a full cup (225ML).<br />A single serving Latte is about 1 full cup, 8 oz. (225ML) A double Latte is 1 ½ cups (350ML).<br />An Espresso single serving is between ¼ and a 1/3 of a cup (75ML). A double serving is a little under ½ cup (125ML).<br />So when brewing any one of the selections a double serving is actually 1 ½ servings instead of 2 full servings.<br /><br />There is one thing that might become a problem with it. And that is the little filter cups. As a retired machinist and seeing how these were made I can see a problem with them getting clogged up with fine debris &/or mineral build up from the water. They have a double bottom in them with several tiny holes smaller than a needle in the inside piece. There is a small gap between the part with the holes on the inside and the outer piece that has a single hole in the middle that's a little bigger than the ones on the inside. The only way for water to pass through it is by being under pressure. And as small as the holes are it won't take much to clog them. And when enough minerals from the water build up in the tiny holes and between the bottom pieces they will have to be replaced. I think it will be just like the holes in a shower head getting clogged up with minerals. Except the holes in a shower head are several times larger than the size of the tiny holes in these filter cups. I'm only using water that has been run through one of the Brita water pictures with the replaceable filter to help prevent the buildup. If only bottled water is used in it that might help prevent buildup in them too.<br />I think it's a bit over priced. $200 for a machine to make coffee a cup at a time is a pretty high price for something made mostly of plastic. And of course, it is made in China. So it probably cost about $2 to manufacture it. So personally I'm not very comfortable with recommending buying this one at this price.",5,2013-05-16,2.0,,,"A nice Coffee brewing machine, but over priced.","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

4532,1,"I went on Amazon to purchase my 3rd Keurig frothing pitcher (they are such junk that they self-destruct starting a month after purchasing & are unusable 6 to 9 months out), when I noticed Mr. Coffee had an espresso machine with a milk frothing device.  I thought, Mr. Coffee, that's a company (unlike Keurig) which one can trust to make a well engineered product.  (I now have 3 Mr. Coffee burr coffee grinders, so I reason to believe this was so.)  So I bought it, & can say, it took a little time to get into a routine of using it without spilling coffee grinds all over the place.<br /><br />I have purchased several espresso makers over the years, a good European electric one  w/o a frother, a good Senseo w/o frother that requires pods, a  that makes good but weak espresso, an expensive European stainless steel stove top one w/o frother that makes strong espresso, the Keurig that requries expensive pods, makes bad espresso, takes too much time to use, is in every way poorly engineered, and has a milk frother that costs about $35 to replace every 6 to 9 months merely because it is made of cheap plastic.<br /><br />With all that in mind & with the Mr. Coffee machine routine mastered, I can say, & my partner says every day, the Mr. Coffee machine makes the best tasting espresso/cappuccino ever experienced, better than Starbucks by far, better than all my other espresso machines, better milk frothing too, better engineered by far at such a reasonable price and without expensive pods (where who knows where the coffee is from).<br /><br />If Mr. Coffee comes up with a new & improved espresso machine w/milk frother, I will purchase that one too, not the least of which is because I appreciate a supporting an excellent company that makes the investment in Research & Development to come up with a great product that does what the customer is led to believe it should do.",5,2016-10-09,120.0,True,,a good European electric one w/o a frother,"Color: Red<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
4533,1,"This machine is pretty compact so it does not take up too much counter space which is great. I have to admit I didn't have high expectations for an espresso machine at this price point, but my boyfriend and I are totally amazed by the espresso this machine produces. There is a slight learning curve but you figure it out really quick. I use Cafe Bustelo ground espresso and have been using the plastic tamper that comes with this machine. The majority of my shots have tasted pretty good but I always mix my shots with milk. It does produce a crema but the shots are not super syrupy or thick. There were only two times that the espresso turned out bitter but I was playing with different amounts of ground in the filter and tamping the espresso using different pressures.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of reviews complain about the frothing arm for milk. My frothing arm did not look the same as the one in the picture (it was actually located towards the rear of the machine - not the best location) but I figured out the best way to get hot, steaming, foaming milk. When I use this machine I have to move it toward me because of the location of the frothing arm. I removed the plastic sleeve from the wand because the plastic sleeve was causing milk to splatter everywhere which seems to be a common complaint in reviews. By removing the plastic sleeve I no longer have the milk splattering issue and I also have more control over the amount of foam I want. I can heat the milk with minimal foam, or heat the milk longer to get more sweetness and more volume.<br /><br />Another word of advice is to make sure you use enough water in order to get enough steam for your milk. The espresso craft holds 8 oz and numbered for 2 ounce shots. If you want four shots you need to fill water up to the top of the metal band on the craft. If you want two shots (4 oz), you need to fill the water up to the imaginary 3 shot line or higher to get enough steam to heat and froth the milk. General rule of thumb is to add 1.5 to 2 additional ounces of water for frothing the milk. Keep in mind you have to manually change the brew feature to the steam feature once the brewed espresso hits the desired number of espresso shots in the craft. Have your cup of milk ready and submerged in the frothing arm when you change the brew feature over to the steam feature. By adding the additional 1.5 - 2 ounces of water you will have more than enough steam to heat and froth your milk. I usually have enough steam to clean the frothing arm with a clean cup of water after my milk has been heated. I also noticed that milk also tends to cake the wand so have a kitchen towel or bar mop towel handy to wipe it down after each use.<br /><br />If you are unsure or on the fence about purchasing this machine, you should buy it! I have been using this machine every morning and multiple times on weekends to make shots of espresso, one morning I drank 8 shots.....not sure if that is healthy. But that should tell you the quality of espresso this machine produces, no one drinks 8 shots in a day if the espresso tastes bad right??? Yes, you may need to tweak your espresso brewing skills a bit to get the taste you want, but making espresso is considered an art form you perfect to get the taste you want. You cannot expect to press start, walk away, and have the perfect cup. You have to create it the you way you want it and you can with this machine.",4,2016-05-29,67.0,,,"Good for the Price, Makes Yummy Lattes","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

You have to manually turn knob to stop machine from shooting the shot which I don’t mind. Machine is not too loud which I heard was a problem on others.

It is fairly cheap and it is very easy to use. I have only owned the thing for a week so I cannot speak to durability. I bought this along with a grinder(bur mill cuisinart for $40) and a bag of quality beans all also available here. It produces a wonderful shot and also creates that cappuccino which I crave in the morning. All said this cost just over $100 and within a month and a half it will have paid for itself. The only thing that I would warn about is that this is not turn on and walk away unit. You have to manually turn off the brewing process and you have to clean it yourself instead of Barista at Starbucks which means that all said it will take about 15 minutes in the morning to brew and clean up the machines. That being said the coffee really takes less than 2 minutes to brew the first shot so you can pause it for satisfying the craving and then finish the brew. I do not find this a tremendous imposition and I have fallen in love with the machine.<br /><br />Things to be aware of:<br />- the scoop that comes with can be used as a tamper but it is easier to have a proper tamper to tamp the grinds. It requires about 49mm tamper to cover the filter completely maybe a mm or two more would fit as well.<br />- does not come with a frothing pitcher which is needed for creating a cappucino, latte, etc.<br />-I would recommend reading up on espresso making so that you understand the possible mistakes that can be made(how to store beans, reasons for bur mill over blade grinder and such)<br />-Be careful to unplug the machine and then switch to steam in order to release the pressure so that you do not burn yourself when removing parts for cleaning.",5,2010-12-27,,True,,"For the price, cannot go wrong","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

4565,1,CCB Coffee Cafe Barista is a compact machine. It tucks in neatly into a corner and can be operated easily without needing to move the CCB. The double shot once charged makes tasty lattes even with coarse grounds.<br /><br />Personally I have RO reverse osmosis water which is at 7 ppm for TDS (means it's soft water). The machine takes a few minutes to pressurize and heat the water. Currently this unit is peculiar in that it overflows on the first cup after having being switched off for a while. Since this is in the morning it is a hassle. The only way to mitigate the problem is to dial the foam setting down to latte and use less milk and then refill later.<br /><br />The espresso shots are tasty even with the coarser ground. The cappuccino and lattes can be messy but are also delicious.<br /><br />Compared to the De'Longhi EC155 you get a bigger machine with more weight that does not shiver during operation and can accommodate mugs. The output IMHO justifies the price point with the quality of the shots and latte.

Press it twice for the larger size. The only negative for me is that you cannot put a large travel mug under it. It will not fit.

But it makes a decent shot and the shot has that jolt you only get from espresso drinks.<br /><br />One thing I learned right off the bat is that the coffee is very bitter if you use too fine a grind.  Apparently, it is explained online that is true for many espresso makers, because they will burn the coffee in the process of making the espresso if the grind is too fine.  I grind my own, so it was easy to adjust, but it may not be for some that buy their espresso coffee already ground. If it comes out bitter, that is why.  Once I adjusted the grind, it was fine.  One way to know if the grind is too fine is that water remains in the coffee grinds so they float.  You will notice it when you go to make your next cup.<br /><br />My issues with it are few.<br /><br />1. It is a very light appliance, which is fine, but when you try to lock the xxx in place, it moves the entire thing, so you really need to grasp it two handed.<br /><br />2. The grind issue is important.  This cannot deal with overly fine grinds and is not adjustable to manage them.<br /><br />3. It does not automatically stop when a shot has been delivered into the cup.  It keeps going until you shut it off.  As such it can make a regular cup of coffee, so that is fine, but YOU must wait for it and shut it off.  To get a shot, you must use a cup that let's you see when the proper amount of coffee has been dispensed.  Would be nice if that was automated so you could select the number of shots to make.",5,2018-02-07,,True,True,Give the jolt and makes a decent shot...,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
4576,1,"This machine makes the process simple enough to make a good cup throughout the day and not have too much maintenance in doing so. You still need to clean out the puck, rinse your filter holder and grounds basket, and wipe the milk wand with each use. Also know that it continues dripping when done; so, I put an empty cup under it until I can finish my espresso and get back to clean it. But it is very simple to use and tastes great if you have freshly roasted beans and a good burr mill bean grinder set to fine for espresso. Drip (store ground) coffee will not work well and is probably stale by the time you buy it from the shelf. My wife loves the double latte and I use the cappuccino setting. Replace the coffee grounds press with a simple 50mm one here for $7 (all metal to support a 30 lbs down force) and you will be happy. Use a folded towel or better yet a silicone mat or cutting board for the press surface so as not to damage the drip holes on your filter holder. Beware that full &#34;foam&#34; setting (at the before 3 o'clock position) will overflow your large 10 oz. coffee cup and run down into the drip tray. Make sure your milk tray is not missing the silicone pickup tube inside (mine was, not available to order; but you can make your own with a 3/8&#34; i.d. tube cut about 4 inches long).

4578,1,"I purchased this Espresso maker due to it's reviews and being an &#34;Amazon's Choice&#34; product.  It is a nice little machine and pulls beautiful shots. I am disappointed because I couldn't figure out why the shots don't have the distinctive flavors of the beans. The coffee flavor essentially disappears in a 4-shot Americano once I add a small amount of half-and-half. I used to own one of Starbucks small machines that ran about the same price and did not have this challenge. I have a nice burr for grinding and have had two professional baristas try their hand. They agree with me...the flavor is weak regardless of the fresh grind size, tamping pressure, water, etc. We figured out that the water temp is not getting above 167F (without) running through espresso, when closer to 190F is recommended.  The temp drops even more when it is ran through espresso beans. This matters, as does the pump pressure. Unless I find some magical answer to fix the temp, I'll likely get a different machine that provides the coffee flavor I'm looking for so that I don't go back to my coffee stand habit.",3,2018-05-15,2.0,True,,Good if you don't like strong coffee flavor,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
4579,1,"I got this machine because I was so tire of Dunkin' making cappuccinos I was throwing out and even Starbucks product being very uneven. Also, it saves you money if but only if you make more than a hundred coffee drinks.<br />Cappuccino tip: If you use the larger coffee holder and press the button twice for the large cappuccino you still get quite a small cappuccino--like maybe 4 ounces of milk and 2 of coffee. To make a large cappuccino, I aim the frothing tube to the cup, make sure the dial is on ""froth"", then press and hold the cappuccino button for 3 seconds, until it starts up. This will make a continual amount of milk that will not stop until you press the button again. So don't walk away. Now you have the amount of milk you really want. Once you have turned off the milk, press and hold the espresso button for 3 seconds till it starts up, where it will run till you press that button. This will allow you to run a bit more water through the grinds and get all the flavor out of it. Now you have a great cappuccino of the size you want. And if you like it stronger, leave the cup in the machine and refill the coffee holder and run another espresso through it. CLEANING: If you want this machine to last, keep it super clean. So when you are done, clean the mild container, then replace it. Put a cup under the brew area. Turn the dial to ""clean"", then press and hold the Latte button for 3 seconds till the machine starts. It will run a designated amount of time in which it will shoot clean steam through both the plastic tube that draws the milk from the container and the metal tube that puts milk in your cup. Remove the milk container and clean all the parts with soapy water. Next, remove the coffee holder from the brew mechanism, throw out the coffee, and clean both pieces. Clean off the machine portion where it brews with a sponge (careful, it's hot), replace the coffee holder (both pieces), and run a double espresso amount of water through it. Now remove it and clean it. This will keep the machine very clean and extend its life.

So I ordered another one via Amazon and the water tank on that one smelled of plastic or glue so badly that it rendered the cappuccino undrinkable and never washed out now matter how may times I flushed it with water. I now have a 3rd unit purchased directly from Mr. Coffee and although the water tank has only a slight odor to it (which leaches into the coffee), steam flowing through the steamer stem into the frothing milk tastes as bad as the coffee from the 2nd unit.

Also overall material of the machine is cheap. After a few uses I can see already coffee stains forming on the espresso extraction aluminum cups thingies. Doesn't come out with wash.<br />PROS: The price is ok. Doesn't take long to make 1 cup. Makes good decent espresso. I prefer this over starbucks and Dunkin. Saves me lots of $$$.

4752,1,"I'll give tips after a little background info, what wasn't right and what customer service said to do, that WORKED!<br /><br />First off my background.  I am not, nor have I every been a barista.  I am an average person who likes mochas from the coffee shop, but I live 80 miles from town, so I don't get them very often and wanted to try making them at home.  This is my first espresso machine.  I read a lot of blogs and watched online videos from real baristas giving tips how to make good espresso drinks at home before purchasing this.  I got this thing and things didn't taste right to me, bitter.  So I did more research and figured out the problem, it wasn't heating up well.  I checked temperature and it was only getting to 157*F on average (too cold) and took 14-15 seconds to make one shot (too fast).  NOT what the online advice says you need.  Online advice says 170-180*F and 27-30 seconds is about right.  So I called Mr Coffee for help before I sent it back to Amazon.  GLAD I did.<br /><br />The call: In short, customer service told me to run a cleaning cycle per directions from page 16 in the user manual.  Which is 1/2 tank of white vinegar, hit the button for double shot.  Repeat as many times as you need.  Also run a cleaning cycle through the milk dispenser.  My thought was, ""what the heck, its a new machine!  I did the priming as directed before use, how can it be dirty?""  But I had to give it a try or send it back.  Well I'll be go to heck, it WORKED!<br /><br />While directions said you only need to run it few times.  I had the time, so I ran the whole 1/2 tank white vinegar through (double shot at at a time) since I has to toss the vinegar anyway, so why not really clean it eh?  Anyway, after a couple times running the double shot espresso button the temperature went from consistent 157*F to 175-182*F.  Wahoo!  It seemed to matter how long I let it warm up between shots.  Running two times consecutively got the 175-177*, which is just what you want.  Letting it sit and warm up a few minutes before runs got it 180-184*, which is getting a little too hot.  BTW, I was using a good quality quick, calibrated thermometer that I use for caramel making, which is a very exacting process to do right.  So I figured it could accurately measure the espresso before it cooled from air temperature, which by the way is mere seconds I found out.<br /><br />NOTE:  The higher temperature is NOT for drinking comfort (how hot you like it) it is what the espresso NEEDS to properly extract and not be bitter.  You can let it sit a few minutes if you don't like it that hot, personally I don't want a burned tongue, so I wait a little.  Coming out of the machine perfect drinking temperature is NOT a good thing.<br /><br />SECOND NOTE:  Running the vinegar through is NOT descaling, it is cleaning.  Descaling is something else you do, read the manual on how.  The vinegar clean is NOT priming, it is cleaning.  Don't know why you need to clean the new machine in addition to priming, but DO it anyway.  Make sure to rinse the reservoir out, then run some PLAIN water through to remove the vinegar afterwards, do it as many times as it takes to get the smell out, mine took a full reservoir.  Honestly though it's faster shipping it back and waiting for a replacement machine because it doesn't get hot enough, this WORKS.<br /><br />When I first got it, as I said it was taking 14-15 seconds to run the shots through.  During the cleaning process they got longer and longer.  Now that it's clean, it's about 28-30 seconds.  Again, just what you want.  I use my cell phone stop watch feature to be accurate.<br /><br />In summary, based on what I've read and how I got it to work well, at least for ""normal"" person standards.  This a good machine.  Here's my TIPS TO GET IT WORKING RIGHT:<br /><br />1.  Learn to grind grounds well.  Do NOT buy pre-ground, buy beans and grind them yourself.  It has to do with when the oil is release one how well it works.  If you are going to the trouble to use a machine like this (rather than just normal a coffee machine) you can go to the effort to grind as well, it's just part of the process.<br /><br />You can use the hand held cone burr grinders for the most accurate fine ground.  Or you can spend a bundle on an electric burr grinder.  From what I read, you REALLY do need to get a good one if you go electric.  In fact that is almost more important than the machine they say.  Inconsistent size of grounds will yield inconsistent shots.  Too fine (Turkish grind, which is like flour) and it clogs the filter making the machine unable to push all the water through.  Too course (regular coffee machine grind) and the water goes through too fast making it bitter.  Espresso grind has to be the consistency of table salt.<br /><br />I'm cheap, so using the hand grinder does work and I advise it for other cheap people.  However,  in the morning I am cranky and impatient, I'm also lazy, so I've ordered a couple different electric burr grinders to see if that works as well.  I plan to return which ever (or both) that don't grind as the espresso NEEDS (good ol Amazon prime and their return policies).  No, I did not take the online baristas advice and buy a $200 burr grinder (I am cheap after all), but I did spend about $50 on a burr grinder and $20 on a blade style.  Will update when I have decided what works or not, which I kept or if I end up just doing the hand grind.<br /><br />2.  Learn how full to fill the cup.  At least to the top of the rim, or a little higher.  You want the end result about 1/8-1/4"" from the top.  The amount in the cup DOES matter.<br /><br />3.  Learn how to pack your grounds to 30lbs of pressure.  How to do that, put your bathroom scale on the counter.  Use your tamper to push until you get the feel of 30lbs pressure.  Repeat several times until you can push it pretty accurately.  This is very important.  Also, but a metal tamper, the plastic one isn't sturdy enough for 30 lbs pressure, it bents and packs unevenly.  You can get metal tampers cheap, it's worth it.<br /><br />4.  Before you make your cup each morning, warm the machine as directions indicate, but ALSO run a shot of plain water through first.  The second time through will be hotter, and it only takes 30 seconds.<br /><br />5.  Even though it's a new machine, and you did the priming as the manual says, run 1/2 tank of white vinegar through it (directions on page 16 of manual) and it will make a tremendous difference.  Don't argue, just do it.<br /><br />6.  You can open the lid and fill the reservoir with it ON the machine with a pitcher if taking it on and off is too hard.<br /><br />NOTE:  I did NOT receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  This is a good machine for the average espresso based specialty coffee drinker.  I gave it a full 5 stars because it's pretty idiot proof (I'm not the most mechanical person) and it makes mochas that are pretty darn good in my average persons opinion.  I have no idea what a real coffee expert would say, and really, shouldn't they have a professional machine anyway?  [...]",5,2016-04-20,3087.0,True,True,"TIPS THAT WORK!

4753,1,"I love my Mr Coffee Cafe Barista. It makes great espresso, cappuccino, latte, etc.<br /><br />However, there is a dangerous design flaw that needs to be fixed ASAP. There is a tiny wood screw holding the 3 pieces of the portafilter together. This tiny wood screw works its way out of the plastic piece and falls into your coffee!<br /><br />I discovered this when I poured a shot of espresso into my new $215 Nutri Ninja Auto-IQ Blender to make a bulletproof coffee. The tiny screw tore up the metal blades before I realized what was happening and turned it off. I guess I am lucky because ordinarily I would have just gulped the shot and the screw would have ended up somewhere in my digestive system.<br /><br />When I fished the screw out I couldn't imagine where it had come from. I saw the tiny hole in the bottom of the portafilter but I just could not believe that Mr Coffee was using a wood screw into soft plastic to hold the portafilter together! Especially when, as was bound to happen, if it worked its way out, it would end up in the coffee! But later when I was cleaning the portafilter I saw that it came apart into 3 pieces and it had never come apart like that before. I had saved the little screw and I saw that, incredibly enough, this was what had been holding it together!<br /><br />I have included pictures showing the pieces of the portafilter and the tiny screw that is supposed to hold all it together. The translucent thing is a seal between the other 2 parts. The red arrows point to the places where the screw goes.<br /><br />Mr Coffee needs to fix this issue and provide a free replacement portafilter to everyone who owns a Cafe Barista.<br /><br />If you own or buy a Cafe Barista I urge you to be proactive and remove the little screw before it works its way out on its own and you end up drinking it.

4754,1,"While shopping for an espresso machine, I went back and forth on this machine and a similarly priced Delonghi. I came very close to choosing the Delonghi, but what pushed me to the Mr. Coffee was my intended use.  I wanted something that was very automated, while still allowing the freedom to use my own ground, not pods.<br /><br />My out of the box experience was that the item was simple to unpack and prep for use.<br /><br />TIP: this ships in it's product box, so if you want extra protection or this is a gift, check off the &#34;Ship in an Amazon box&#34; where offered.  After setting up the maker, washing it's compartments etc. I was ready to prime it.  This took just a few minutes.<br /><br />The unit comes with all you need - just add electricity, water, milk, and coffee.  It includes a water tank, milk tank, two filers (single and double), a porta-filter and combination scoop/tamper.  It has a 26&#34; cord and is 1,040 watts.  It is advertised as 15 bars.<br /><br />The unit heats up quickly and is easy to use.  The advertised drink sizes are pretty accurate, so choose the right glassware!  You can also make custom sizes by overriding the Espresso button.<br /><br />TIP: Consider buying another filter so you can prep two or three filters with coffee and make several drinks faster when serving a small group.<br /><br />The drinks you can make are:<br />* Espresso:  Single (1.25 ounces) Double (2.5 ounces)<br />* Cappuccino:  Single (6 ounces) Double (10 ounces)<br />* Latte:  Single (12 ounces) Double (15 ounces)<br /><br />TIP:<br />As far a tip on glasses, I ended up buying:<br />  * Bormioli Rocco Easy Bar Espresso glasses - these are TOO small for a double espresso.  They claim they are 3.5 ounces but actually measure out to be 2.5 ounces filled to the brim.<br /> * Bormioli  Rocco Oslo Cappuccino Cup - excellent glass and at 7.5 ounces easily fits a single cappuccino and allows for extra froth.<br /> * Anchor Hocking glass mugs - about 16 ounces and great for lattes and the double cappuccino.<br /><br />The Mr. Coffee heats quickly, and each set of lights pulsates until at a ready temperature.<br /><br />The entire setup is simple to use, add water, add milk to the froth container, add your coffee and you are ready to go.<br /><br />My lone complaint about this product is the porta-filter.  I find mine requires an abnormal amount of strength to lock it into position.  I am not overfilling with coffee, and even tried it with empty filters inserted in the porta-filter- same problem.  I actually ordered a replacement machine but had the same issue.<br /><br />Other than that quirk, it is really a great machine.  It makes excellent drinks, and with minimal effort on your part.  You can customize your froth simply by using the Cappuccino button override.  After you are done making drinks, clean up is easy.  You can store your froth container of milk for later use in your fridge.  To clean up, just set the froth dial to 'Clean' then hold down the Latte button to override drinks and put the machine in &#34;clean&#34; mode.<br /><br />Basically, outside of the On-Off button on the side, you do everything with three buttons (Espresso, cappuccino, and Latte). Press once for a single drink, twice for a double, and hold down the buttons to override (custom drink size, extra froth, and clean).<br /><br />There are little tray areas you can pull out or remove, depending on your glass sizes.  You can also fit the smaller filter in one of these tray compartments when not in use.  Do NOT leave the porta-filter attached to the machine when not in use, as this may add wear to the filter assembly.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this machine.",4,2017-06-13,129.0,True,,Amazing convenience - Great Caffe!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
4755,1,So i'm really sad to write this review. If you had asked me for a review during the first month of use (3 double shots brewed daily) I would have rated this machine 5 stars but after less than two months of use this machine will no longer brew espresso.  The pump starts to sound like it's working and then goes quiet when it starts to &#34;brew&#34; and nothing comes out. Prior to this issue the machine made the sound the entire time the espresso was brewing. I followed the manufacturers instructions to ensure the porta filter was not clogged. I've let vinegar sit and ran vinegar through the unit a few times to &#34;delime&#34; it as Mr. Coffee suggested in their response email to my complaint with no success. I've wasted a ton of espresso trying the unit again after each unsuccessful &#34;fix&#34;. There is no reason for an espresso machine (for whatever reason) to stop working in two months. I'll update this review after I have time to sit on the phone with Mr. Coffee as they walk me through more &#34;fixes&#34; for a two month old machine.

It does not, you will have to watch the machine and shut off the flow of water.<br />• I don’t know what they mean by this claim. Nothing is in the portion of 20oz- except for the glass decanter, which is not included. The filter baskets are for one (1 oz) and two (2 oz) shots of espresso respectively. These filter amounts are not marked accordingly, but one is taller/larger than the other. The water reservoir is a quart (32oz).<br />Description:<br />Easy-pour 20 oz. glass decanter features a stay-cool handle and drip-free spout, and serves up to 4 shots---<br />o Glass decanter was not part of this package and the 4 shots refer to the decanter size<br />15-bar pressure pump system allows for optimum flavor extraction----<br />o Very nice pressure makes creamy frothy espresso.<br />Steam espresso machine brews up to 20 oz. of espresso---<br />o Maybe 20oz is how much you can brew without giving the machine a rest? Not sure on this one.<br />Easy to use Milk Frother for creamy cappuccinos and lattes---<br />o Froths and heats milk very well; user will need to practice to get it right.<br />Removable, washable drip catcher keeps brew space tidy----<br />o Convenient for cleaning<br />Includes measuring scoop for a perfect cup of coffee---<br />o Scoop doubles as tamper. I prefer my metal one over this plastic one, but it works fine. I really appreciate the fact they include one with this pack. If you don’t have one yet, this one works well to get you started brewing.<br /><br />Start-up<br />I think it took longer the first few times, but is very quick now.

4757,1,"I am not a professional by any means, but I was a barista at a successful &#34;mom n pop&#34; coffee shop for a year, so I know how to pull a good shot and properly steam milk.  I like good coffee, but I'm not a stickler. I wanted to be able to make my own espresso for americanos and the occasional latte at home. I did my research and decided on this machine because it's under 100 bucks which is what I was looking for. I also was looking at the Hamilton beach one that's under 100, and the delonghi. I know that's a better brand but this machine was a little cheaper and had similar reviews. This one is very user friendly, you definitely don't have to have barista experience to get a shot from it. Extreme coffee people might say it doesn't pull a &#34;real&#34; shot because it doesn't require espresso fine ground coffee (real espresso grounds should be as fine as powdered sugar and fit between the lines of your fingerprint) you can actually use it with regular ground coffee for a drip machine, although I use a burr grinder and have it set somewhere in between the two. You don't need to buy a different tamper; the one it comes with is definitely the worst tamper I've ever seen, but with this machine you really don't need a heavy tamper to pack it down hard, because it doesn't make pucks. Even after a decent shot, the leftover grounds come out as sludge instead of a puck, but it seems that's just how this machine works. It's definitely not coffee shop quality but if you want to be able to make coffee that is more than just black brew from a drip machine, then this gets the job done. I like it a lot, it's not for you if you're going to be picky about a syrupy vs runny shot, or how many seconds it takes, but if you just want some espresso with a good layer of yummy crema from your own home for well less than a hundred bucks then this is for you.

We have a traditional espresso machine and were looking into another one to make the lattes, and during that search, I found this amazing machine for both espressos and lattes!<br />The set up was fairly easy and straightforward, just MAKE SURE THAT YOU REMOVE THE RED COVER FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WATER CONTAINER before you start using the machine. The water container is extremely convenient, as it holds a large amount of water and you won't need to fill it every time you make an espresso -unlike traditional espresso machines.<br />There are three different options: ESPRESSO, CAPPUCCINO AND LATTE. You have one button for each option. If you press the button ONCE, you will get a small portion (single shot). If you press it TWICE you will get a bigger portion (double shot). Under those buttons you have another feature that lets you set the amount of froth that you want (little to none for Lattes and lots for cappuccinos.) After you plug the machine your three buttons will start flashing. You have to wait a few minutes until their light is fixed, when that happens you can start using the machine.<br />To make an espresso you simply fill up the filter with your desired brand of ground coffee (you have a single and double shot filters between which you can easily switch) and press the espresso button either once or twice. Your coffee will start pouring within SECONDS. To make a latter of cappuccino is the same procedure, except that you will need to fill up the milk container. To remove the milk container simply pull it horizontally towards you; to put it back, push it horizontally towards the machine until it &quot;clicks&quot; into place. You have arrows on the container and on the surface of the machine that will touch each other when the milk container is correctly inserted.<br />The only inconvenience for us is that even a double shot is not enough for us 5, we have to make TWO double shots. But since it takes seconds for the espresso to be ready, we can't complain. With our traditional espresso machine we had to wait 5 minutes for the espresso to start pouring. Besides, sometimes only my parents are home and if they made too much then it would go to waste, so they do a single shot with this machine and that's just enough for both of them.<br />I was hesitant before buying this machine because of all the negative reviews about how fast it broke down, but I'm glad I decided to take the risk and buy it. I have been using for almost three weeks now Multiple times a day for both espressos and lattes and I have not seen any sign of deterioration (fingers crossed).

4759,1,"I've had a semiautomatic espresso maker/machine for the last five years. I've brewed about 4600 cups of espresso with it. With that said I have some idea of what a good espresso shot is about.<br /><br />First off, this machine requires a thorough cleaning before you use it. One other person recommend cleaning it with vinegar, and this seem to help.<br /><br />In order to produce a good espresso shot, you need to have the right amount of coffee, the right amount of pressure for tamping, and finally a length of time for brewing that is not too long or too short. Get one of the variables wrong, and the quality suffers. Lastly, a good-quality blend of coffee. I use a local roasting house, and coffee that's about $17 a pound. Avoid the cheap supermarket stuff, and go to a local roaster.<br /><br />If you use the enclosed spoon you'll get somewhere around 11 or 12 g of coffee. Most sources I've read recommend between 14 and 18 grams, so you'll want to use a rounded spoonful.  You'll also need about 30 pounds of pressure for tamping, and  the enclosed tamper they give you will bend under that kind of pressure, and will probably result in uneven compression. (Hint--Buy a steel tamper!). No professional uses a plastic tamper.<br /><br /> If you get about 14 to 15 g of coffee in the porta filter,  then brewing time is around 25 seconds,  which is just about perfect.  This produces nice crema.  I preheat the machine on mine by running a double shot through the porta filter while empty, then wiping dry,  and finally go on to making the cup of coffee.  if you follow these steps you can produce a pretty decent shot.<br /><br />As to the milk frothing mechanism,  I think it's a joke.  I can make a wonderful froth  from about 4 ounces of milk, and  this uses way too much milk.  I want to taste coffee not milk.  I guess if you like lattes,  that you may like the frothing part.  I use a standalone frother, and  find it a whole lot more economical and easier to clean.  By letting it sit for about 30 seconds I can get the perfect blend of milk and froth for cappuccinos. There's less control with the built in one Mr. Coffee uses. I can also say it's a pain to clean this built in one, and residual milk tends to build up on the plastic if you let it sit. Again, I'm much happier using a standalone frother, and they are only about 30 bucks to buy.<br /><br />I also picked up the Mr. Coffee Burr grinder, and it seems to produce a nice grind for this machine, and also seems consistent in its output. The two seem a nice match for one another.<br /><br />I think the week part of this whole system is the frothing. As an espresso maker, I think it does a fine job. Quality is not quite as good as my semiautomatic machine was, but decent for the price. I paid about $147. Price seems to go up and down a lot on Amazon. Currently it's $181. Not sure I'd pay that much for it.<br /><br />Time will tell just how good of a value this is, but pump seems to be quite capable, and I'm told you can order parts for it, which is more than I can say for a lot of the machines out there. Packaging was outstanding. Probably something we all take for granted these days until you get something that arrives in pieces. I admire a company who takes the time to engineer a good packaging system, and Mr. Coffee did it right. The machine comes well protected, even the plug receptacle end is protected. Nice.<br /><br />Overall I think it's a good machine, but again I would recommend a standalone frother for best results and economy.<br /><br />One other thing worth mentioning is you can get this machine for about $70 without the milk frother, and that's what I would do. I found after trying the frothing a few times my coffee taste like milk, and is on the warm side instead of hot side. I don't see any reason to pay for something that is really subpar, so again, if I had to do over I would just buy the standalone machine without frother.<br /><br />Update: Tried the milk frother a few more times, and it overflows a 12 oz. cup every time, and froth is pretty loose. Foam should be dense. I now run a double shot of water through before I brew, and this helps with temp, but milk frothing is still sub-par IMO. I think I will send back, and just get the $70 version.

The body is light and the espresso arm did not snap into place strait, like it was supposed to.  It's too tight a fit.  Sorta strait was the best we could get it to... Also, the main knob was stiff to turn, making the transition to espresso to steam messy and they CHANGED THE STEAM WAND.  Now, this plastic nozzle has holes at the top that forces the user to completely immerse the tip and NOT be able to make foam like a regular barista.  It fries the milk and leaves it flat.  You should be able to put the tip near the top and pull foam for a latte.  With this model, if you do that, it sprays milk all over the place.  And the steam wand gave way too much powerful steam and not in a consistent stream, but irregular blasts!  It's dangerous, in my opinion and it makes poor quality, bad tasting espresso on top of that. If the steam wand wasn't so horrible, it might have salvaged a 3 star review, but this is so disappointing, I want to return it.  I betcha it's made in China, now.

4782,1,"This is a pretty good budget item. I was really dreaming of the one that automatically froths milk but it's  $140 more. This espresso maker DOES have an awful plastic smell. I noticed it when I opened the box and became alarmed. I ran a water cycle twice with no improvement. I then put a 50/50 water/vinegar mix in and let it soak for over half an hour before letting that run through the system. Ran another 2 water cycles and noticed improvement but plastic odor was still there. Did the vinegar water cycle once more (this time letting it soak for an hour before running it through). Ran hot water twice more and noticed the water did not smell or taste like plastic. I left the lid off the machine over night to let it off gas and today I made my first espresso. Not too bad if you're not super picky. If your frother isn't working, add water to the reservoir. Keep the plastic tube on otherwise it makes a terrible sound.<br /><br />The plastic odor is stronger if your device was more recently produced. Off gassing takes time. Many other coffee machines deal with this problem. For this machine you might see some success with my method mentioned above. I also recommend leaving the lid off as much as possible until odor is gone.",4,2016-05-08,,,,This is a pretty good budget item,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

4788,1,"I recently purchased the Mr. Coffee ECM-160 on the strength of the reviews here on Amazon.  So far I am very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />It seems pertinent in a review such as this to note that I'm not an extreme espresso aficionado, and in fact, I've only recently become interested in making espresso at home.  I understand that the espresso this machine creates is different in viscosity than that of a 'pro' machine, but I'm not interested in investing hundreds of dollars into this hobby.  For anyone looking to tentatively try their hand at brewing espresso at home this seems to be the perfect machine to, if nothing else, gauge your interest.<br /><br />The ECM-160 is extremely compact, so it won't burden your countertop with excessive clutter.  The nice brushed aluminum trim belies its price tag, although the plastic drip tray does not.  Operation is extremely simple, with a nice rotary knob on the side that selects between brew and steam modes.  I'm still experimenting with grind size and tamping force, but I've made espresso that is far stronger than any other coffee brewing technique I own (French press, percolator, drip) contrary to some of the reviews.  It even creates a nice layer of light brown foam in the final 10 seconds of brewing that resembles 'crema' (again, I'm no expert).  Brewing 4 cups only takes a few minutes.<br /><br />The frother works well, although it is awkwardly close to the body of the machine.  I've been able to create very rich milk foam with a little practice, which helps make a great latte/cappuccino.  The plastic `frothing aid' and metal frothing tip are both removable for easy cleaning, which is a plus.  No, it doesn't come with a frothing mug, but at this price, who could expect that?  Some stainless steel mugs cost half as much as this entire machine.  The flattened bottom of the scoop works well enough to tamp the grounds in the filter, too.<br /><br />So in summary, this is an excellent little espresso machine for the mild enthusiast not looking to break the bank.  A few trips to the local coffee shop will pay for this machine, which is reason alone to give it a try - so it's an added bonus that it works so well.

4791,1,"After reading all of the positive reviews I decided to buy this machine rather than a more expensive brand.  I had a previous version of a Mr. Coffee cappuccino machine which was decent but broke after a few months so I figured I could replace this machine many times for the price of one of the more expensive brands.<br /><br />I don't think that my machine is defective, but it might be.  The problem with the machine is that the amount of coffee (and even watery, milky-foam--not the best foam) produced is quite variable from cup to cup.  Not only is this annoying, but the ratio of milk to coffee is always changing the taste of the cappuccino.  I use the same mug every morning.  Sometimes it is 1/4 full, once it was completely full--all by pressing the cappuccino button twice (for a large).<br /><br />According to the manual, I should use a larger grind of coffee and/or not tamp down as much.  I have not tried changing the grind (an ""espresso"" grind from a very good, local coffee shop) but tamping clearly makes a difference.  If I tamp it firmly, little coffee comes out.  If I barely tamp it, roughly the proper amount of coffee comes out but the taste seems different.  I wonder if this means that the pump is not strong enough?<br /><br />A few weeks in, I am still using it and it produces drinkable results every morning--but turns out to be less automatic than I was expecting.

4803,1,"When I was hunting for an espresso machine on Amazon, I was confused between this product and the De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker, which had 6 times as many reviews as this one with nearly the same rating. In the end, I chose this product instead. And even though the De'Longhi product is $12 more expensive than this one (at the time of this review), it wasn't so much for the face value price difference that I bought the product instead. The reasons I finally went for this product were the following:<br /><br />1. You can easily fit a 10 cm tall cup under this one (for both the portafilter and the frothing tube), which means that I did not have spend money buying demitasses. The De'Longhi machine has a small clearance and therefore you can only fit demitasses under it.<br />2. This machine comes with a tamper thus saving more money than buying the De'Longhi version that does not come with one.<br /><br />Of course, this one does not come with a frothing pitcher, so either you can buy one (which you will need to do for the De'Longhi machine too) or use a narrow adequately sized container.<br /><br />In the end, I don't find any difference between the espresso produced by this machine and the one I get in coffee shops. Therefore, I don't see why I would go for a $200 - $2000 machine instead. This product is easy to use, involves following straightforward instructions and makes good espresso. Also, you can choose how much water you want in your espresso as you control the water flow in this machine.<br /><br />As with any electronic machine, it is always best to follow instructions if you want good performance from it time and again. Do not leave the portafilter on the machine if you do not want the spoil the seal and clean thoroughly and often. Don't leave the machine turned on and let it cool often enough. Do spend time reading the instructions before you operate this for the first time. It takes no more than 15 mins if you were to read carefully.<br /><br />In conclusion, I am glad I went for this product instead of the De'Longhi one. I saved me a lot more money than the face value price difference and I can use this machine to make me a tall cup of espresso on the days when things are just not going my way :)",5,2013-07-25,6.0,True,,Excellent product for little money!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

4829,1,"I received this as a xmas gift. I was excited to try it out, as I was spending quite a bit on lattes at places, and I figured it would be nice to save money. Unfortunately, this machine seems to fall flat.<br /><br />I have a burr grinder and ground to what I read was espresso consistency; between powdered sugar and salt. I had mine closer to salt when you rub it between your fingers. Apparently that's too fine for this machine, even though it says to grind to a salt consistency in the directions. I even tried using my scale to get an exact weight for the double shot filter. No matter what I do, it just can't push water through the double shot. It took me about 5min to get 2oz because it just drips out so damn slow. I tried packing it a little looser, i tried packing tighter, i tried using slightly less. So forget about using the double shot filter unless you use a coarser grind (at which point it doesn't seem like it could be considered an espresso grind).<br /><br />I had to switch to using the single shot filter. Even then, it seems to push water through slower than it should. And that was with a weighted/measured amount of grinds. A whole lot faster than the double shot filter, but still not within the 20-25sec range I've heard is optimal. But it's awful that you can't use the espresso grind with the double shot filter because it means you have to brew two individual single shots. And that means you have to brew a shot, then empty, clean, and dry the filter, and then you can brew the second shot.<br /><br />On top of all of this, the brew really doesn't seem to come out that warm. Using pre warmed mug & shot collection glass, by the time you're done with everything and have it combined for a latte, it's only mildly hot, and is lukewarm within 5min.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed it didn't come with a couple cups, or at least a metal frothing cup. Kind of hard to make anything when you're just starting out and you realize you don't have anything that can work as collection cups, and finding a frothing pitcher locally is impossible. You can't even fit a doubleshot glass under each spout because they are too tall. You can't fit an average mug (pretty sure mine are 8oz and typical height) under it. Can't easily find smaller sized mugs/cups that will fit. You pretty much have to use regular shot glasses. I had a small measuring glass I bought that worked while also allowing me to see how many ounces I was getting out of what time frame.<br /><br />I've seen people mention the filter basket is very hard to lock, and that's true. I have to wrap my arm around the machine to hold it while the other hand locks the thing into place. However, I would rather have the tight seal than have to worry about water spraying out due to a loose seal. My overall opinion of the machine is that it can do an okay job, and is fine if you are okay doing only single shots, or using a coarser grind. But if you aren't okay with that, then I would look for a better machine. I'm sure there must be one out there.<br /><br />If it matters to anyone, I have been using Death Wish Coffee (barrel brand and valhalla java) in my machine. Both came out looking great.

4876,1,"I have been on the fence about buying a home machine for a very long time. I kept reading review after review and never took the plunge. I saw this model for $50 on sale at target so I figured what the heck. I think this is one of the best purchases I have ever made. My wife loves to go to starbucks a few times a week and spend $6 bucks a pop on a cup of coffee. This machine saves her the trouble and she raves that it makes a better cup than she usually gets at starbucks. It took about an hour of practicing when I first opened it to figure out how to get the most out of it, but it has been totally worth it.<br /><br />It is important to read the instructions, otherwise you will be confused by the blinking lights and wonder why it wont brew your coffee. I was very suprised at how quickly this things heats up. You turn it on, the light blinks for about 30 seconds. press the brew button, the light blinks for about 10 seconds and then you are ready to brew your coffee. when that is complete, press the steam button, wait ten seconds and you are ready to start frothing. This thing is really quick and easy.<br /><br />The only negatives about this are that it does not come with the little espresso cups pictured so you have to be carefull about how long you let the coffee brew, and that it does not come with a frother. I have made due so far by using a standard 2 cup pyrex cup and it works just fine. I will be purchaseing 2 little espresso cups and a 12 ounce frother once I get back to the store. Other than that, this thing works like a dream. It holds more than enough water in the tank to make many cups without refilling. It is a good idea to grind your own beans so that you can get them to the right consistency, it is also important that you fill the filter but dont compress it. If you do, it will drip espreso slowley and you will think the machine is broken.

The coffee comes out so much better with the added pressure of the pump that is built in to this one and the steam never loses pressure.  The water reservoir makes it really handy too since I don't have to be measuring water every time like I used to with my other machine.  One thing I would suggest to the manufacturer however is to include a separate tamper instead of the cheap plastic one that is part of the measuring spoon.  I purchased a separate one so I'm happy.

4883,1,"This espresso maker has been my favorite so far, in its size and workings, although it has a few peculiarities.<br /><br />Before going on to other things, I would mention that it is now September, 2012, and I insert this paragraph.  We bought this machine in February, 2011.  It has become enough of a leaky fountain, squirting a steady stream of water from the frother while it expresses coffee, that we have decided to retire it.  It didn't start out that way.  It was good for about four cups per day for a year and a half.  Maybe it can be repaired; not sure.  We're back to using the Hamilton Beach machine, which leaks much less so far.<br /><br />We like to have our cappuccinos twice a day, and we have been through a couple of steam pressured Mr. Coffees and a Hamilton Beach model with a pump. One immediate preference for us is to be able to make a good cup but not spend hundreds of dollars.<br /><br />At first, we didn't relate to people's complaints about water leakage, but after about 14 months we repented.  One possibility for leakage, of course, is removal and reinstallation of the tank.  I tend to just fill the tank using a small pitcher, which I think is easier than moving the tank around.  Leakage from the tank hasn't been an issue for me.  Then, this machine ends its cycle by clearing its lines, as far as I can tell, and that pushes a fair amount of water into the catch tray.  If you don't empty the tray periodically, it sometimes overflows and gets water on the counter.  On the happy side, the catch tray gets washed a lot and doesn't get grungy.  The third source of water after a year, though, came to be the steam spout.  It would sputter away and drip quite a bit while the espresso was being made, and at other times, so we often put a wash cloth under it to catch the drops.  It was a small bother that we could tolerate, at least while it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />It seems as if every espresso maker has its own personality.  When we got this one, it spewed quite a bit of steam up along the tube, inside the rubber tip, so it seemed as if the machine was getting steamed more than the coffee.  I soon found that the metal tip under the rubber was not screwed into the end of the tube.  I screwed it in, and that stopped the back rush of steam, but then the milk, which I was steaming directly in large mugs, tended to bubble up and overflow.  After that, I used the steamer with the tip pretty much unscrewed but pushed close in position, allowing some steam backup but not having the milk bubble over.  Like so many things, there is what the book says, and then there is the extra touch that you get to learn with experience.<br /><br />The height of the steamer and the bay are nice for my use. I froth the milk directly in mugs, and I can let the mug rest on the edge of the stand and hang against the steam nozzle, building froth while I do other things during that short period until the milk just begins to boil.  After a certain period, usually just about the time the milk in a mug starts to boil, the steam cycle shuts off.  While this is fairly reliable, I have to keep an eye out so that the mugs don't boil over.<br /><br />To froth a second mug, the previous frothing cycle normally has ended. One can wait for the lights to flash and the lines to clear, or it appears quite fine to shut off the machine, wait a moment, turn it back on, and get to the next frothing a little sooner.<br /><br />Two particular things we have learned: Don't put an extremely fine grind into the basket, or it will block the brewing flow.  Espresso grind is good. Also, when filling the basket, be careful about coffee getting under the rim, between the basket and its holder.  Even a little of this can pack tightly and make it difficult to clamp the basket in place for brewing.  If the clamping is difficult, check this and thereby avoid damaging things.<br /><br />This espresso maker gives an excellent crema, as many have said.",3,2011-03-12,4.0,True,,"Not perfect, but we liked it.

4885,1,"I received my unit a while ago and, after getting used to fiddling with all the pieces and waiting for the ""explosion"" described in other posts, I am completely satisfied and somewhat disappointed (no explosion). I can see where other reviewers might be mislead into thinking the cord is very short but all you have to do is turn the machine over and actually look at the place where the cord is stashed to see there is a pretty lengthy cord wound around a very clever stem in a hidden compartment.<br /><br />As for the quality:<br />I had been using a Hamilton Beach machine that is very different in operation so reviewing the instructions fully really was a must. Based on other comments, clearly most people don't read or follow the instructions because everything you need to know is there in black and white.<br /><br />The brew function is very quick and only takes about 15-20 seconds to heat the water in the reservoir and start running hot water through the grounds. The whole process is very quick and you can fill the carafe with 4oz in less than a half minute. My other machine had a reservoir that you could leave full but this machine discourages that. I use a Brita filter for all my water so the chances of mineral buildup are reduced a little. Seeing how hot the reservoir gets, I would not recommend leaving water in the reservoir.<br /><br />The carafe has a slotted lid so the spout from the filter fits neatly into the top of the carafe so there is no spilling or splash.  The steamer arm is fixed with no allowed movement but it is spaced high enough and far enough out from the main body that using a pitcher or coffee cup to froth milk is very easy. The booklet goes into very specific detail about how to clean the froth arm but the pressure of the steam basically blasts the nozzle clean if you allow the unused water in the reservoir to exit through the froth arm when you are done making your foam. A barrista friend of mine steams a clean towel then uses that to clean the foam nozzle on her own machine. I find that works well between proper cleanings. One note is that Soy milk froths well but leaves a film from all the dissolved solids. If you use Soy milk, plan on cleaning the nozzle frequently as the particles get to be like glue if they are not wiped off shortly after being warmed.<br /><br />As for which grounds to use, I have tried both standard grind and espresso grind coffees and you definitely need to find a finer ground of coffee for use in this (and any) espresso machine. I have a lot of Starbucks standard grind coffee to use up so I simply sent it through my Cuisinart for a few minutes to get it broken up finer. It seems to work equally as well but there is a noticeable difference in brewing strength.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased.",5,2012-01-20,2.0,True,,A delicious expresso in less than 20 seconds!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

4894,1,"If you are expecting to brew a nice cup of capuccino using this machine straight from the box, then you might be disappointed.  You can, however, make some mediocre espresso or latte.  Here is why:<br /><br />Need to buy the following first, as these does not come with the product:<br /><br />1. Tamper - you need to tamp coffee with 30 lbs of force to make good espresso.  this will also help build the pressure for the frother to make microfoam (and not dishwasher foam) for your capuccino.<br /><br />2. Milk thermometer - scalding the milk will just not work out<br /><br />3. Frothing pitcher - least important of the three as you can improvise.<br /><br />Another tip for foamy capuccinos: after brewing the espresso, turn the knob to the Off position and let stand for about 5 seconds.  Slowly turn on to ""Froth"" to start frothing your milk.  You can swirl the milk while frothing to dissipate the larger bubbles that ocasionally pop up, or knock the cup down on the counter.  For people like me who is obsessed with getting creamy microfoam, this took some time to master.  Industry practice tells you to put the tip of the frother just below the milk to get good froth, but the inconsistent pressure that this machine builds you sometimes have to put the tip all the way down to minimize the large bubbles (but by this time, I would have realized I did not tamp correctly or the coffee ground size is too big. However, good tamp and grind as there may be, this machine still churns out inconsistent (or weak) frothing pressure!)<br /><br />Would recommend this as a ""practice"" gadget before moving on to the more expensive, indulgent pump espresso machines :)<br /><br />Good luck! :)",4,2011-02-11,,,,"Great machine, if you know how to use it!","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

4959,1,"Have had this machine for 18 months now, and both my husband and I love the results. Fortunately I'm a reader of directions; you really need to study them carefully before you brew your first pot. It took half a dozen rounds of delicious experimentation to tweak the original instructions. Now I have the process down to a science, with detailed instructions posted next to the machine. In all these months, after many expensive comparisons, we have yet to taste a commercial cappuccino that tastes as good as ours.<br /><br />I did order a steaming pitcher with the machine but found it much too small for our milk use. I have ended up using it just for depressurizing the machine, for which it's perfect. For my household, the best steaming pitcher is an ordinary one-pint glass measuring cup. And the best tamper turned out to be a flat-bottomed scoop from a can of protein-powder I had sitting around.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, the quality of the coffee beans is critical. We buy the best organic espresso beans we can afford (Trader Joe's has a great blend) and grind them fresh each morning for that morning's two batches. We also use distilled water for the most flavorful coffee of any kind. I had read that caffeine reacts with the chlorine in tap water; it certainly makes a noticeable difference in taste.<br /><br />Tip for a good foam: cold milk in a cold pitcher. At the start of preparations, I pour 1 1/3 cups cold almond milk in my 1-pint glass measuring cup and stick it in coldest spot of the refrigerator. The colder the pitcher, the thicker the foam. This morning, I had placed the pitcher right underneath the freezer motor and the milk had ice crystals on top. For the first time, the froth came out so dense and hard that it looked and behaved like whipped cream!<br /><br />So far, this sounds like a five-star machine. Unfortunately, early on, it developed a problem that cost it one star. The screw at the end of the steam wand lost its thread and has to be carefully forced into place. Last weekend, it came loose at the end of the second round and the machine spewed steam all over the place. I had already steamed the milk to near-perfection, so nothing was lost. The depressurizing process was messy and noisy, and the screw had to be forced out the plastic shield with a sharp metal object. But this weekend I managed to get the screw back in place both mornings, and our cappuccino was better than ever.

4965,1,"I had this machine  for a couple of weeks, and it did not work from the very beginning. The pressure is not even close to the advertised 15 bar. It is so low that cannot push water through coffee. I experimented with different grinds size, and tried not to tamp coffee too tight, but i did not help. I only wasted several ounces of coffee beans. If you use a small filter, coffee comes out just for a couple of seconds, and after that it just drips slowly while the pump is still working. When you use a two-shot filter, water only drips slowly or is not coming through at all. Just FYI, I used only distilled water, and usde it only 5 or 6 times, so there could not be a problem with limescale.<br />I called the manufacturer and explained the problem. They asked me to give them the serial number printed on a sticker located at the bottom for the machine. I had to remove the water tank and overturn the machine to read it, but it was hard because it is printed in a small font. They suggested that I replace the item. But after reading reviews that mention the same problem (weak pump), I am not even trying to play a lottery by replacing it because it may stop working any time. It looks like this machine has an inherent engineering flaw, and the manufacturer must know about it. However, they continue selling this faulty product. Returning it now. I washed filters and wiped out fingerprints, and nicely packaged the machine (it took me about an hour). It now looks like brand new, and some of you who did not believe bad reviews and decided to play this lottery is going to get it soon. I have to add, it was very nice of Amazon to issue a free return after I called them.<br />P.S.<br />I bought this machine for $125, now I see it's about $200 (probably, because it's about Christmas time).

It takes up very little space on the counter. It is simple and easy to use. As a guy, reading directions is not a big part of things. Even still, it's pretty hard to screw up. The first few times I used it I had some variety in results, but due to getting the perfect grind and tamping and not due to a defect in the machine. The steam powers through my finely ground beans with no problem, and the tamper is just fine. Same with the steamer, it works great. I bought five of these in 2010, four as Christmas gifts and one for myself. Never got a chance to use it as I was soon back overseas.

I can barely plug it in with it flush against the back wall of the counter.<br /><br />The coffee filter basket has a different insertion style with those I've used previously. You insert it on the left-hand side of the machine and slide the handle to the middle. This is contrary to most machines where the insertion point is in the middle and you slide it to the right.  This is awkward and I've ended up spilling coffee all over my counter if it does not insert correctly.  Once, it was not seated in the slot correctly and spewed coffee grounds and watery coffee all over my counter.<br /><br />The frother does not work as instructed. I found that if you waited until the coffee was 3/4 brewed and then frothed, it would give you better results.  Also, that plastic thing on the frother did not improve the function, so that got taken off.<br /><br />The top of the caraffe falls off when you try to pour out the coffee.

I drink cappuccinos & my husband likes espresso.  He said the espresso is good and the frother works great!  Some reviewers said their frother didn't work - well it's not in the directions, but you need WATER IN THE RESERVOIR TO STEAM THE MILK. Obvious...but it's not printed in the directions.  And you can't brew & froth at the same time, so if you froth the milk after you brew, you have to turn off the machine, add a bit of water, then froth the milk.<br />It'd be nice to be able to brew & froth at the same time, but for $28 what do you expect?  Also there is no burner under the caraffe, so you have to drink the espresso right away or it gets cold.<br />I don't see the need for a tamper (the plastic one included is fine), and I use a coffee mug to froth the milk in.

5029,1,"This is a poorman version of a semi-auto espresso maker but a very very crappy one at best.  It doesn't do any one thing well.  If you are looking at this unit to save time, then be warned it will NOT save you anytime over manual espresso makers.  Because of the poor design, it requires A LOT OF CLEAN UP after  each use and there is no way around it.<br /><br />1) one button espresso shot maker - I can never get an equal shot out of this machine, it's either over or under, never consistent amount of espresso.  This is especially true when you use the latte or cappuccino button, you can tell sometimes it just stop the espresso shot when the shot just started.<br />2) milk frother - not really a frother, more of a bubble maker and it splatters milk droplets all over the places because of the fast and violent high temperature boil it does to the milk.  Because of the unit is black, it's very easy to see the milk droplet splatter after every use.  Your drink will have hot milk, espresso, and milk bubbles - no milk microfoam whatsoever.<br />3) milk container is poorly designed - as several reviewers said, it requires a lot of force to insert the container or remover it, you can actually  splash milk out of it during insertion or removal because the energy required to insert or remove the container.  Because you will need to store the milk container in the frig, there is no getting around of not removing the container after each use.  Also, there is a sensor that detects the milk container and it will would not let you start a drink until it thinks the milk container is properly seated.  The sensor seems to be effected by temperature.  After the milk frothing process starts and the mechanism is heated up a bit, my unit would randomly sudden-stop the frothing process as if the milk container was removed or loose, even though it is pushed back as far as possible and perfectly seated.  This would require removal and reinsert the milk container to reset the fault condition before unit will allow you to restart a drink.<br />4) milk pick up tube problem - the tube pick up design has problem dealing with the changing vacuum force needed to draw the milk to the frother.  When the milk container is full, it has no issue pulling the milk but as the milk level gets lower and lower, the tube struggles to draw enough milk.  In my experience, when the milk container is about 1/3 or 1/2 full, the latte or cappuccino created will not have enough milk, or become extremely inconsistent.  In those cases, you will have even more milk bubble as less milk gets the high temperature boil, creating an even bigger mess.<br /><br />I think the idea of this machine is to partly automate the creation of an espresso drink.  Since it doesn't grind the coffee, the only thing it automates is the milk frothing.  However, the milk frother and related mechanism are so riddled with design flaws, the process is anything but consistent and require a lot of clean up after each use.<br /><br />I actually clocked myself, factor in clean up time, it actually takes less time to make a latte or cappuccino using a less expensive manual espresso maker with a standard build-in frother.",2,2013-04-13,18.0,,,good idea but a lot of issues,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

I trusted that the 12 month warranty would be protect me in that case, but I wondered if it would be worth the hassle if I had to use it.<br /><br />Fast forward: I really like the product. I brewed probably 300 cups of espresso and it worked well. Then it blew a gasket. When I called Jarden, who now owns the Mr. Coffee Brand, the customer service rep assured me that the product was manufactured at least 3 years ago and was therefore not in warranty. He had no interest in my purchase receipt, dated 11 months early. When I refused the steam expresso machine that he offered me as a ""one time courtesy"" and because the comparable unit was ""not in stock"" I went to the Mr. Coffee website and confirmed that it was indeed in stock, for purchase.  When I refused the replacement and insisted that because I had purchased the unit less than a year ago, that the company should honor the warranty. The response was that the unit was not in stock, and they encouraged me to check back with them in 4-6 weeks.<br /><br />I'm sure many people give up at this point and the customer service objective of not paying warranty claim or paying them at a much reduced price is realized. I bought the product and the warranty. I didn't realize until I needed it that the warranty was not actually included. When I asked for it, I was told that I didn't really buy it. Interesting!  I'm probably powerless to enforce the warranty.  It's certainly not worth any more of my time to try.

Now, to be clear, I know enough about how espresso machines work to know where to keep my expectations when buying a $40 steam espresso maker (when at work we use a professional machine that cost more than some new cars). That being said, this someone managed to fall short of even my lowest expectations...<br /><br />It arrived last night and I excitedly put it on a 2-shot test run (yes, after reading the manual carefully). The very first thing I noticed was that a good deal of steam was escaping from the screw top. I had read similar reviews of this happened and ensured that the lid was screwed on tight, but thought maybe it wasn't tight enough. The machine is obviously slower than what I'm used to at work, but for what it was, it didn't take *too* long to pull a double shot.<br /><br />This morning I decided to put it to the test and pulled 4 shots- the max the little carafe (which feels about as fragile as an eggshell) can hold. I did everything the same, triple checking this time that the cap was screwed on tight this time. Not only did it take 15 (yes, fif-teen) minutes to both steam my milk and pull the 4 shots, but it started leaking and cracking on top of it! Even more steam was spitting out the top, and through a newly formed crack where the top of the machine is literally pulling up from the body. I noticed a great deal of condensation around the shot pulling mechanism (triple checked this was fully locked in place) and the &#34;backsplash&#34; of the machine. When I checked though, it wasn't even leaking from the shot bit, but condensation was forming out by the screws that keep it all held in place.<br /><br />tl;dr- There's a reason this machine cost $40. It is so incredibly cheaply made that it would be laughable if I didn't honestly feel that it was potentially dangerous. Haven't even had it for 24 hours and already going to return it because it's ALREADY falling apart. To add insult to injury, the shots taste like burnt dirt. I fully admit this could be in part due to my own inability to properly grind/tamp espresso manually, but any shot that takes 15 minutes to pull is going to be exposed to heat for too long and taste burnt.<br /><br />Don't buy this product.

Your head is getting ready to explode as you read about things like burr grinders, with some Amazonians subtly implying that if you don't use one of these for your home-roasted gourmet coffee beans - the ones you import weekly on a private jet from an exclusive estate in the Ethiopian Highlands - then your intellect must compare unfavorably with that of certain lower primates.  And then there are the reviews that provide detailed instructions regarding this or that machine's temperamental foibles and intolerance of idiots, advising you sternly that if you don't do X, Y and Z in a very particular order, accompanied by ritual chanting and animal sacrifice, your $2000 espresso machine will never perform in the optimal way.<br /><br />Or so it sure seems sometimes.<br /><br />So here's the key question: WHY do you want an espresso machine?  Do you truly want to become an espresso master, the envy and talk of all your Yuppie friends (""Wow, Bob has a Lockheed-Martin X-320 Parisian-Bistro-Espresso Cafe Super-System with built-in burr grinder and rocket launch module, and he sure knows how to use it!"")  Or do you just want a machine that costs (way) under a thousand bucks that'll make a tasty latté or cappuccino in the morning, and in so doing save you from supporting your local coffee shop owner's boat payments?<br /><br />If it's the latter, then I humbly recommend this fine little machine.  It's easy to set up, and if one uses decent ground espresso (for the record, I use Lavazza) it makes excellent coffee drinks with a minimum of fuss.  You don't need to fiddle with frothing yourself - just hit the right buttons and it will turn out coffee that will have you saying ""Mmm, that's good!"" before you proceed with your day.  Unless, of course, you're a coffee snob who wouldn't dream of using anything smacking of ""automatic"" that doesn't involve multiple complex steps, a $300 grinder, manual frothing, a degree in engineering and animal sacrifices.  But then if you're that person you're probably not looking at this machine.<br /><br />Put the machine through a clean cycle regularly, and DO delime it at least once in a while.  It's a tedious procedure but not doing so may affect performance (we had some issues a few months in and deliming fixed them).<br /><br />Do follow the setup instructions carefully, especially with regard to priming the machine the first time.  And don't do what I did, which is to wonder why nothing was happening - specifically, why no water was coming out - and then finally notice the sticker on the back of the water tank that said ""Remove plastic plug before use"".<br /><br />Duh.<br /><br />UPDATE, JUNE 2014: A year after we bought this, using it every day, it has started to exhibit issues with the frothing.  Despite deliming, it is having a harder time getting up to pressure and producing froth.  It still works, but doesn't froth as easily and I have to usually run it a couple of times to get the volume we had a year ago.  This machine has nonetheless saved us a ton of money over the past year and I'd still recommend it (and perhaps buy another when this one finally dies).<br /><br />As some others have noted, the reservoir sometimes leaks water.  My stupid but effective solution to this was to insert a strip of thin cardboard (part of the flap of a small cardboard box works) between the machine and the reservoir (i.e. behind the reservoir).  Apparently this ""pushes"" the reservoir back enough to set it right, and it fixed the issue.",5,2013-06-25,109.0,True,,Great little machine... not sure about durability (see update at end),"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
5037,1,"Love this machine and it's not as complicated as other reviews say.  Taking off a star because I'm on my second machine in under a year, but it's still cheaper than if I buy a Starbuck's latte every day.  I used the Mr. Coffee steam espresso machine for several years and it's nice to be able to push a button and walk away for a moment.  For those who want to make coffee every day with this machine, here is how I make Starbucks-like mochas and lattes without all the fuss mentioned in some of the other posts.<br /><br />Easiest way to keep your machine clean is to use distilled water.  Run distilled water through both coffee and milk areas to clean after use.<br /><br />I get Starbucks Espresso coffee ground for espresso.  I recommend that you buy only a little at a time, like 1/2 pound or 1 pound to make sure it's fresh.  Keep the coffee out of the light (in a cupboard) and don't refrigerate it.  I pick it up at the Starbucks drive-thru.  The plastic tamper works is fine for a great tasting coffee.  The barista's at local coffeehouses do not use a plastic tamper and some advocate not tamping at all.  The grounds shouldn't be too packed.<br /><br />I bought a 28-30 oz Turkish coffee stainless steel pot to hold my drink while it's brewing.  Be sure to order one that is the right size, mine is 30 oz, bought on Amazon.<br /><br />Turn on the machine a few minutes before you start making your drink to give it time to heat up.  I like to make two lattes, one that I drink right away and one that I save for an hour later that I keep in an insulated Thermos cup that stays hot for hours.  If you put your drink in a thermos (for hot drinks), it will actually get hotter.<br /><br />To make sure the milk container is in all the way, press it in at the top and the bottom. Bottom should align with arrow, but don't just focus on bottom, top needs to be pushed in too.<br /><br />After you've made your drink, remember to put the milk container in the refrigerator and return the dial to the left (after cleaning) to your coffee preference.<br /><br />Starbuck's will sell syrups by the bottle, I get Vanilla or Caramel.  For mocha's, you can get a chocolate syrup or hot chocolate mix at the grocery store (I buy a fancy hot chocolate powder like Silly Cow Farms Chocolate Chocolate) and put some in the bottom of the cup and stir it as you pour the coffee into your cup.  Use syrups and powders to taste, start with a little first.  I also like to mix the Caramel syrup with a teaspoon of chocolate powder for a turtle latte.",4,2016-10-07,2.0,,,Simple Tips from someone who is not a barista,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

(I buy wax paper to dispose of the coffee grounds in an environmentally sensitive, and easy-to-clean way.)<br />-- The espresso tastes funny after about 3 weeks.

5041,1,"I received this item as a Christmas gift. I love coffee, Starbucks, and Alton Brown, so when I added the phrase &#34;an espresso machine might be fun&#34; to my Christmas list, I had a more manual machine in mind. The automatic controls and frothing &#34;compartment&#34; had me thinking &#34;Keurig&#34; not &#34;hand-crafted espresso&#34; like I was hoping for. (Entitled thinking, I know... but it was a Christmas wish list, after all, and this is an honest review. So out with the confessions! lol)<br /><br />After a very careful unboxing (it's quite tedious), I took some time to read the instructions before diving in. I completed the priming, which is similar to priming a Keurig. I used Cafe Bustelo pre-ground espresso coffee and half-and-half creamer for my first few cups.<br /><br />It comes with a coffee scoop, but I've found that it's a bit of a liberal measure for the metal filter. Go just shy of an entire scoop, then tamp it down. I didn't bother with a scale (forgive me A.B.!), I just used the weight of my shoulder straight down onto the grounds, tamping in between scoops for the double shot filter.  Watch the coffee / espresso episode of Good Eats to get a great tutorial on how to do this. It might be worthwhile to invest in a tamper if you use this every day, as the one that comes with it is a bit flimsy, and feels like it will break if used at the wrong angle. The filter was very tight to lock in place, but from some of the Q&A's I've read, it appears that reducing the amount of grounds will make it a bit easier. (Hence my comment about the measuring scoop.)<br /><br />I usually like the feel of a large mug in the morning, so all my coffee mugs are big. If you're like me, you're going to struggle a bit to get your mugs under the machine spout. It takes a bit of finagling. And some of my mugs simply don't fit. So choose your mugs carefully. The slide out lifter for demitasse cups is nice, and you can always brew your espresso shot into a rocks glass and transfer into a coffee mug, but that's a lot of work.<br /><br />Using this method, I brewed several shots of espresso. Every shot came out consistent, rich, and tasty. Each had an impressive amount of crema (that frothy-brown-coffee part at the top of your espresso).  No grounds in the cup, and all grounds seemed to have been &#34;used&#34; during brewing. Smooth espresso taste. Very pleasing.<br /><br />As for the milk frother: In the beginning, I frothed the milk into a separate cup and poured it into my espresso for cappuccinos and lattes. I'm EXTREMELY impressed with the quality of foam, temperature of the milk, and flexibility of the ratio (milk-to-foam). Using the separate-cup method even gives me the option to try for those pretty designs the baristas do at my local coffee shops.<br /><br />Cleaning was a big concern for me as well. That milk compartment looked a bit sketchy. However, I've found a cleaning regimen that seems to work well for me: 1) Clean before first morning  use; 2) Make my morning coffee; 3) Clean after last cup of coffee; 4) Put entire container back in fridge. I probably won't let it go more than a few days without cleaning the entire thing in the sink. The instruction manual says that the milk frother and lid (!) are dishwasher safe, but I'm skeptical about that. I'm erring on the side of caution and simply washing it in the sink.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a great start for anyone wanting to venture beyond their Keurig or drip coffee maker and explore espresso at home. I'll try this for a while, and perhaps graduate up to something a bit more sophisticated later.",5,2017-12-27,,,,"For So Much Automation, I Was Pleasantly Surprised","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

Clean the steaming wand frequently.<br /><br />When I make cappuccino or latte, I usually have to clean the wand very thoroughly before I get enough steam pressure.  Maybe it's because I have hard water and don't clean the machine often enough with vinegar--your mileage may vary.<br /><br />This doesn't bother me because I drink espresso every morning so I don't use the steaming wand very often--usually only when guests want something else.<br /><br />2.

My husband sticks with mocha lattes from the shops, but he is an aficionado of coffee, always interested in new ways to grind and brew coffee at home.<br /><br />We have fiddled with this new-to-us type of machine long enough now to have figured it out for the most part.<br /><br />I always start with cream in my cup before brewing, adding milk or cream from the frother after brewing.<br />I top it with a sprinkle of nutmeg or cinnamon sugar.<br />The result is comparable to coffee shop breves, but the foam is never quite as tight.<br />Milk froths better than cream, but no type of dairy product keeps its frothiness for long using this machine.<br />Foaming is not its star attribute.<br /><br />The metal pitcher that came with our machine is useless for frothing. You need a much smaller container, preferably glass, in order to see what you are doing. The container needs to be small and narrow enough for the arm to reach to the bottom. The longer you froth, the hotter the milk becomes, but you can froth till the cows come home and never get a tight foam.<br /><br />Plain espresso shots are easiest to make, and they turn out quite well, depending on the quality and type of beans used.<br />The finer the grind, the stronger and tastier the drink.<br />You should always use a fine grind when using this type of machine.<br />Using this machine, a shot of espresso comes out with a nice layer of foamy coffee on top.<br />The cute little espresso cup that came with our machine is perfect for this.<br /><br />I did some research to determine what makes espresso different from other coffee drinks and was surprised to learn that ALL specialty coffees begin with espresso.<br />The addition of steamed and foamed milk makes a cappuccino, more steam and less foam make a latte, cream turns it into a breve, the addition of chocolate adds “mocha” to the name, and so on.<br />The variety is endless, but it always starts with a shot of espresso.<br /><br />We have found that it is best just to pull the plug between making each drink.<br />Don't bother to turn the machine off first.<br /><br />Be sure to clean the area where the handled filter cup attaches to the machine, as well as the filter itself.<br />This assures a good seal.<br /><br />Clean your machine after you use it each day. It's not that much trouble, and it will keep your machine in good working order.<br /><br />I would say that this is a fine first espresso maker, but if you are accustomed to using them, you would want something more advanced.<br />This is the “training-wheel bike” version of espresso machines.<br />If you are a ten-speed biker of brew, this machine would likely seem laughable.",4,2018-01-01,5.0,,,Great as a starter machine.,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Café Steam",
5080,1,"Like most who purchased this product, it was my first espresso maker. And I found out quickly that hunting for these things can be overwhelming! I purchased it at my local Target for $79.99 for convenience in case I had to return it -- with all of the mixed reviews out there, I was incredibly weary of choosing one! However, I will most likely not need to do so. It is perfect for all of my needs!<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. Incredibly easy to use! Directions and trouble-shooting pages in manual are simple and helpful.<br />2. Compact size, looks nice sitting on the counter.<br />3. Easy clean-up. All parts that need to be cleaned detach easily.<br />4. A standard sized coffee cup will fit under the spout -- not so with many models!<br />5. The steam feature is simple, fairly powerful, and works well. No problems here.<br />6. As long as you get a good batch of coffee grounds, this machine can turn it into delicious espresso!<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. I have been experiencing a small leak onto my counter after use. I haven't caught it in the act yet, but if I return to the kitchen a few hours later, there is a wet spot near the machine. I read another review that mentioned the same thing, so it might be a universal issue with this product. However, it is a small leak, and not enought to cause a real problem in my opinion.<br />2. I would suggest making 2-3 cups before wasting any milk product on your first trial. This model does not have an automatic drip feature and you will need to manually tell it when to stop pouring. If you are not used to this, you might end up with a few nasty batches on your first try. No biggie. Just watch the color of the drip. It starts out as a medium brown, and changes to a much lighter brown if left alone. I would recommend shutting it off a second or so after it changes to the lighter brown. I have made perfect batches every time by this method. This all takes place over several seconds, so keep an eye out.<br /><br />YOU MIGHT NEED TO KNOW:<br />It mentions this in the manual, but make sure to get the right size of grounds. About the consistency of salt. I would recommend griding your own either at home with a grinder or at the store at a grinding station. They taste better for one, and you won't waste your money on a mystery bag that doesn't work well with your machine.<br /><br />Also, it does not come with a frothing pitcher. You will need to buy one separately. I purchased mine at Bed Bath and Beyond -- a Krups one, stainless, about $10? It fits fine. Just make sure you don't get one that is too deep, or the froth wand will not reach the milk. It is a countertop model after all. If you don't want to use as much milk you can turn the pitcher at an angle.<br /><br />That's it! Definitely more pros than cons. I feel that for the price I paid, I could not have hoped for a better quality machine. I would highly recommend this model if you want something easy and you don't require tons of frills. If you want something more frilly, go ahead and spend $300 to $3000 on one. But I purchased an espresso maker to SAVE time and money (so long, Starbucks!), and this one's just right for me!",4,2008-12-26,385.0,,,A Relief After Tons of Searching!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

5109,1,"After reading the reviews of this product, I decided to purchase Mr Coffee because of the high ratings.  (Although I was skeptical since it is so reasonably priced and you know the old adage ""You get what you pay for"".)  While many reviewers mentioned that it may take some time to get ""the hang"" of frothing, I can't imagine that my problem is simply that I need more practice.  I have owned an espresso machine in the past and was very successful at making mounds of froth.  (I think my old machine was a Krups.)  The instruction booklet states that ""typically 35 - 45 seconds will deliver the proper milk temperature"".  I can't imagine that is possible, but then . . . .  I am using a stainless milk pitcher as recommended; I make sure the pitcher is cold as the recommended; I use 2% milk as recommended,  yet the steam function only produces steam for a few seconds - I would say no more than 10-15 seconds - then it stops.  The milk has a very light froth but is still ice cold.  I have tried turning the steam control off for several seconds, then back on, but nothing.  I have turned the entire machine off and waited a few minutes before trying again - no luck; it does NOTHING.  I did consider returning it, but discovered that I had carelessly put the manufacturers box in the recycle bin so that ended that.  I guess I am stuck with it.  I have convinced myself that I need to keep trying but I find myself avoiding the frustration.  I recognize that the disappointing results could be due to my own ineptitude but my past experience with the other machine was spot-on (however, the steam function in that machine remained on until I turned it off - it didn't shut itself off like Mr Coffee does).  I think that this machine would work well IF the steam function didn't turn off automatically.  Perhaps I will time the steam function on my next attempt to see if it actually steams for 45 seconds or if, in fact, it steams for a shorter period.  And if it does stay on for 45 seconds, then I will KNOW that it isn't me -  that it takes longer than that to heat the milk!  Should I achieve success in future attempts I will update this review.

5143,1,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this machine!!!  I used mine for a year and it just died on me after over 400 uses.  I'm sure it would have lasted longer if I would have descaled it (run vinegar through it) more than every 6 months!!  I just ordered a second one this week and I will be diligent about descaling it.  Amazon has the best price I've seen anywhere though not many big box stores carry this model.  It's a little hard to clean the dried milk off of the steamer when you use it a lot and it gets really caked on, but a little elbow grease every day takes it off pretty well.  I calculated my cost per use for 400 uses and it was $.17 per use.  When you add the coffee, milk, whipped cream, and syrup (I buy directly from the Starbucks stores - it's cheaper than buying it online), it's less than $1 per day (even with Organic milk) which really beats $4.85 at Starbucks!  I would highly recommend this machine.<br /><br />***UPDATE: First of all, the coffee maker I purchased this year (2011) broke so I took it to an authorized Mr. Coffee shop who confirmed it was an internal issue and I got a new one very quickly.  I took it in on Monday and the new one was delivered on Friday.  VERY FAST!!  Second, I have to share that when I purchased this on Amazon, both times, it was around $70.  I would recommend it at that price.  However, I see that it has recently increased to around $100 and I'm sure you could find a higher quality coffee maker in that price range.  Also, the steamer is funny.  If you don't use it every day, it takes a while to work or it doesn't work and you have to descale it.

I really didn't want to write a bad review on this product, but after the second one died within two months with the same symptoms (two lights blinking, and no longer pumps water), I genuinely believe this product has a faulty design that causes serious unreliability. I will not buy a third one.<br /><br />An update: alright, I wrote an enthusiastic review of this product a year ago. But I hate to report that this thing didn't last. It stopped making coffee last week, just a bit over a year since I bought it. Don't know what the problem is, but it gives out constantly flashing lights, and pumps out nothing. I guess the pump is out.

I can use it make coffee that is just as good as Starbucks espresso coffee, if not better.<br /><br />The fact that it takes any ground coffee you have, instead of requiring specially made coffee pads, is the great plus. It allows more freedom of choices and results in big savings in a long term. Quite easy to operate as well.

There are differences in coffees, for example some people prefer Yuban over Folger and can tell the difference between the two. The machine heats the water quickly, takes only a couple of minutes, just enough time for me to pour  the milk into a small pitcher to steam it. By the time I have the milk ready, the espresso is pouring into the coffee pot. The first time I used the machine I didn't know what to do with frothing the milk. And it was a disaster. Milk splattered everywhere. I learned by placing a metal pot under the frothing pot so if it spilled it was an easy clean up. I don't need that extra pot anymore. It just takes a little experience.

I have the copper-colored one which is very nice, every guest notices it.<br />It's very easy to use and the water reservoir is very convenient to fill since it is detachable from the machine.<br />Some general tips which are not covered int he manual:<br />1. The coffee filter will get clogged at some point and the first wall of filter (with the holes) is not meant to be easily detached from the bottom of the filter (which has only one hole). The way I detached it was washing it hot water and then putting into the freezer. As soon as I got out from the freezer, I hit it upside down against the table and the first wall of the filter popped out from he bottom. This is the main difference from other expresso machines which have filters where the two parts can be easily separated and washed.<br />2. When you use milk, get used to start with minimum froth and increase it at the end to generate the froth like in the picture. Use a timer or watch to estimate when you need to turn the froth dial to get the best mix.<br />3. Use a very good grinder than can grind fine coffee as for expresso. I use the Hario manual grinder which is cheap and I enjoy turning it manually. You can shop for an electric one but be sure that it has been well reviewed for fine grinds. I can't stress enough the importance for a good grinder, it is more important than the coffee maker itself. The most important of getting coffee percolation right (which makes that oily coffee flow) comes from using the ideal grind for the coffee.<br />If you pay attention to these tips, you should be able to make better coffee than most coffee shops. And what about the coffee beans? Well, in the US any Starbucks coffee beans are well rated so it's my baseline reference. This coffee maker has had the privilege to make more exotic coffees like the Jacu bird from southeast Brazil ;)<br />I am very happy overall with this coffee maker which is very convenient for everyday use.

5285,1,"At first, I thought about giving this product a lower rating, but I changed my mind, and here's why:<br /><br />First, and most important to me, this machine makes good espresso. Furthermore, it makes it fairly quickly and quietly. Couldn't be happier with that result!<br /><br />Second, and here's the negative, I need to address the auto-frothing wand. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this or not, but the auto-frothing wand that came with my machine was a piece of plastic crap. I had to experiment several times, but each time I used it, I was disappointed. The results were always the same, huge bubbles in the froth on top and hot, thin milk on the bottom, not exactly the foamy, creamy experience everyone wants! I watched some videos on how to froth milk, but no matter what I tried, it was always the same. Then I had a friend who works as a barista at a local coffee shop try it, but she also could not get anything but huge bubbles and hot, thin milk. We decided that the machine produced too much air pressure. I was considering returning the machine, but I decided to try to take the plastic auto-frothing wand off and try to do it manually. My expectations were low, because I thought the fault was with the inner workings of the machine. I'm glad I tried the manual way though, because it actually worked! Using the video techniques I found for manual frothing, I was able to get much closer to making the smaller bubbles for the foam and a creamy consistency throughout the milk. Obviously, it wasn't perfect because I'm still a noob, but I'd imagine someone who really knows what they're doing would easily pull it off. Having said that, I believe the issue was that the auto-frothing wand actually allows way too much air into the milk in the initial frothing stage. However, going manually, I was allowed to control exactly how much air was being added and how quickly it was being added. So, my advice, ditch that little plastic piece of garbage and go manual! It may take a little more practice, but I believe it'll pay off.<br /><br />Third, as pretty much all the other reviews have said, the scoop really does not work as an effective tamper. However, I would not pay the $10-$18 necessary to buy an espresso tamper. For one thing, it's a uni-tasker, which is almost always a big no-no and a good indication that you're wasting money. For another thing, if you have tools at home, you could easily make one yourself. Or, you can do what I did and just use the top of a medicine bottle that you have lying around. A lot of them have the 49mm diameter you need or close to it.<br /><br />Finally, in summary, you can't beat the price on this machine, and it does it's job well. I've had it for about a week now, and it's already been through a quite a few uses. It's worked great! Just make sure that you're cleaning it properly, releasing the pressure after every use, and making sure that no water is left in the machine between uses (that should solve the &#34;exploding&#34; problems that other customers have experienced). The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars were for the uselessness of the auto-frothing wand and the scoop.

It took a few days of trial and error to get down a good process, and for being newbie this is fairly user friendly. Do purchase a tamper and a frothing pitcher in addition to this machine. I will say that if you over tamp the coffee you will end up with leaking and water everywhere so do make sure you read the instructions fully just so you understand how the machine works. It does smell like warmed up plastic the first few times you use it, so it would be wise to do a dry run with just water a couple times to avoid your coffee smelling like that. Now, a quick instruction set that I have found good for me is as follows: for a 16oz drink<br />1. Fill water to the 4 cup mark and put into machine<br />2. Turn machine to steam and let warm up and wait for a constant stream of steam to come from the wand (till there is no water dripping, place a cup under wand to catch drips till its warmed up)<br />3. While machine is warming up, fill coffee filter to the top and then tamp down to the 2 cup mark (do not pack down to hard or machine will leak), then set the filter wand in the lock position<br />4. Once a constant flow of steam is coming from the wand turn machine off and then place frothing pitching with 3/4 full of milk under the wand and submerge.

5329,1,"This is a good machine for beginners and people who aren't gourmet critics about their coffee. It gets the job done and makes it fairly simple to brew espresso. I have only brewed ""2 cups"" at a time and not attempted 4 yet, but I've consistently gotten a well-balanced brew with a nice crema. Although a devoted coffee snob could find criticisms your average Starbucks drinker should be satisfied.<br /><br />As others have noted you should buy a frothing pitcher if you don't already have one, as this machine doesn't come with one. Don't get one too large or the steam wand won't reach deep enough (see below).<br /><br />The main weaknesses are related to the steaming function, and each can be resolved with a work-around:<br /><br />1) The steam wand is just a bit short, meaning even with a relatively small 12-oz frothing pitcher the wand can't quite get as low as you may want because the rim of the pitcher will be bumping up into the arm of the wand. You can compensate some by tilting the pitcher to make the milk deeper at one end.<br /><br />2) The wand is also positioned directly up and down with no tilting possible, which makes it difficult to get the necessary angle to get the milk rolling--though after some practice I was able to achieve rolling milk by tilting the pitcher towards myself (front) and keeping the wand on the left side (machine side) of the pitcher. Although the manual instructs you to move the wand around, being able to get the milk rolling without moving the wand around is critical to creating the velvety microfoam that is the difference between a great latté or mocha and an OK one.<br /><br />3) The steam wand also came with a ""frothing aid"" - a plastic cover with additional holes in it. I guess this is supposed to be helpful, but for my part I was unable to produce microfoam until I removed the frothing aid and just used the naked wand.<br /><br />4) You can't easily steam without brewing espresso first (ex: to steam some milk for a child's hot cocoa, sans espresso), because the brewing process is needed to heat up the water for a few minutes to build up the steam heat and pressure. If you try to turn the steam function on without brewing first, the heating element comes on but you don't achieve enough pressure because the steam valve is open. If you try to run the brew function without coffee in the filter, the water floods through much faster and you end up trying to steam without enough pressure because the the water isn't hot enough yet, or you run out of steam very quickly because so much of the water ended up in the carafe instead of coming out as steam. Thus, the only way to steam without brewing first is to add a full carafe of water to the machine, set to brew, and let the carafe fill up to the 4-cup mark before switching over to steam.",4,2011-02-05,2.0,True,,Good entry-level machine,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
5330,1,"I bought this item after reading mixed reviews on Amazon, hoping for the best and wanting to try it for myself.  After a month, I couldn't be happier.  It makes perfect cappucino, espresso.  I even got crema the first time.  I think it's important to make sure that you are grinding the beans the right way, down to espresso grind.  I think this makes a huge difference.  I have a burr grinder (which I also got from Amazon and is great) that allows me to set it to different grinds. I use the espresso grind when I use this machine and it comes out perfect every time.  This machine is super simple to use, and fast.  The milk (i use soy) froths perfectly, and I use a little stainless pitcher.  I don't see what the complaints are about unless people are using regular coffee grounds or something.  It's also important to tamp down the coffee.  You can buy a little stainless tamper which works great for less than 10 bucks and it will last forever.  It's the little things that make this machine work to it's best potential.

Was looking at the all in one brands which had excellent reviews but they were $600 and up during the holiday sales.  And since I never had a machine like this, I was sure I'd make mistakes and waist money.  So I bought this for $144 on Amazon, was a little cheaper on other sites, but didn't want to wait two weeks to get it.  Instruction were very clear, some misspellings, but clear.  Cleaned, primed the pumps, and then made a double cappuccino.  It came out perfect the first time.  I was amazed.  I'm learning that reading instructions really does help when it comes to machines.  I used an excellent crema espresso bean, also purchased on Amazon.  I kept making different size/types of coffee drinks until I was wired to the max.<br /><br />  I did purchase the Mr. Coffee burr grinder for use with this Barista.  Worked perfectly also.  This Barista, and the attachments are easy and quick to clean.  I noticed that the device has to stages for various cup sizes.  I missed that in the instructions somehow.  You can also remove the bottom stage to place a small/short travel mug in with narrow bottom.  The Mr. Coffee Barista photo shows the cup sitting on the bottom stage.  The first stage for smaller cups, slides out from under the milk foam dispenser.  Since my travel mugs are too large, I pour two large cappuccinos into my travel mug.  I put hot water in the metal travel mug first to warm up the inside, pour out the water, then the cappuccino stays hot.  I have been using the large/wide Starbucks city cups in this Barista.  They work perfectly.

They are complete GARBAGE.  It's a shame, because this used to be a decent product.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />My 5 star review will hopefully not upset some of the 1 star reviewers who don’t realize that water under high pressure - when released quickly - will cause explosive results.<br /><br />Basically this means if the device is on and one uncouples the coffee holder from your Mr. Coffee espresso machine (or any other espresso machine for that matter) you’re going to turn your kitchen into an explosives ordinance proving ground.<br /><br />Yes, I have accidently “detonated” a few sub kiloton “rounds” of espresso myself.

HELLO  I don’t think for that kind of money you’re going to get NASA quality control here boys and girls.<br /><br />Too bad Joltin’ Joe DiMaggio isn’t still around to be spokesperson for Mr. Coffee as he would have enjoyed a nice cup of Italian espresso from this machine.

5442,1,"We have been using this coffee maker for just over two years.  On average we make about 3 cups of coffee daily.  More on the weekends and less when I am the only one home.  There are five coffee drinkers in our household and it can get a work out some days.<br /><br />About the machine:<br />The water resevoir holds 55 ounces and the milk resevoir holds 16 ounces of liquid.<br />You can select the amount of frothed milk you want by adjusting the knob on the milk resevoir<br />You can manually add more milk/froth , or a longer shot of coffee by using the manual mode (hold the button until it starts and press it again when you get the desired amount, or let it turn of by itself)<br />There are pre-determined espresso, cappuccino, and latte modes for single and double sized cups.<br />There is a drawer/shelf that slides out from under the milk resevoir for brewing with smaller cups<br />The shelves that hold the cups are removable for cleaning<br /><br />The manual for this item is on the Mr  Coffee site under the service and support tab.  It is a pdf and gives good information.<br /><br />As far as ease of use and quality....<br />add the coffee grounds, tamp, push a button.  Pretty easy.  Of course, make sure the water and milk resevoirs are full.  Just do not grind the coffee too fine or you may find the filter clogs.<br /><br />Quality.  This has been a sturdy and dependable coffee maker for us.  It takes a minute or two for the water to heat initially.  After that making a cup of coffee is pretty much instant unless it has set long enough to go into a hibernate mode.  Then it will need to reheat the water again before making the coffee again.  Do make certain that you are running the clean mode and occasionally making a cup of just hot water to keep the unit cleaned.  I even add about a half a drop of dish washing liquid once in awhile as well as run vinegar through to keep it cleaned.  If you do not, you may find that the machine appears to lose pressure and won't dispense coffee.  At this point, you will need to spend some extra time cleaning it and it should be ok after that.  Of course, you could actually be having pump issues.  Try being aggressive about cleaning it before you give up.  Especially so if you use dark, oily coffees.  It is advised in the manual to NOT use coffees that have been roasted with or have sweetener added to it.<br /><br />It is noted that you can fill the milk resevoir and store it in the fridge.  I do not recommend this.  The amount of calcium buildup on the frothing tube, etc is remarkable.  And it gets as hard as the bone it helps your body to make.  Save yourself a headache and rinse it right away and then if you want to store it in the fridge, fill it and put it in the fridge nice and clean and ready for the next cup of joy.<br /><br />So far, after over two years, we are still enjoying this coffee maker.  Yes, I have had to get aggressive about cleaning it after being less than diligent about not staying on top of the regular cleaning.<br /><br />It does make a nice, flavorful cup of coffee.  The espresso and coffee have a nice bit of crema and the milk frother is steam operated and also does a nice head of steamy, frothy milk on top.  Is it the same quality that you get at a coffee house?  Not quite.  However, it is very good and much less expensive.  I have not used the expensive versions of this.  I wanted to try this as an entry level machine to see how often we would use it and if it was worth the money.  We will used this until it quits or one of our college aged kids nabs it for their own use.  Then I might consider a more expensive fancy machine.  At this time, this does exactly what we need it to do.  Regular coffee for the rest of the family, a light tar like substance for me, and flavored coffee drinks for those days that you say &#34;to hell with watching calories&#34;.  To make a standard cup of coffee fill the double shot filter basket,  hold the espresso button for manual and it will dispense a nice cup of regular strength coffee in about 60 to 90 seconds.<br /><br />If you are curious about the amount of coffee you get when making a cup of coffee........<br /><br />  HOW TO SELECT THE RIGHT CUP SIZE FROM THE OWNERS MANUAL (manual mode will vary, of course):<br />  Please make sure to select your cup according to the following chart:<br />  BEVERAGE  AMOUNT<br />  Espresso  Single ( )  Double ( )<br />  1.25 oz  2.5 oz<br />  Cappuccino  Single ( )  Double ( )<br />  6 oz  10 oz<br />  Latte  Single ( )  Double ( )<br />  12 oz  15 oz<br />NOTE: The total amount of the beverage can vary depending on the type of<br />milk used and Froth Control Knob setting.",5,2015-04-12,10.0,,,Would recommend,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

If you are using milk or soymilk, the latte will dispense more liquid giving to what you would expect in the size of drink you want.  However, if you use creamer or heavy whipping cream both will not dispense as much since it's thicker consistency but this is probably a good thing as I would prefer less creamer/whipping cream than I would if I am using milk/soymilk.<br /><br />I love this machine!!!! I am a long time user of Mr. Coffee, we own a traditional Mr. Coffee maker and a Mr. Coffee Keurig, both of which I've been super happy with.  Mr. Coffee did not disappoint with this machine either.  I love my latte's but I don't like the $6 price tag.  I drink soy milk so I was so happy I can conveniently make my latte's at home.  I've used the cappuccino feature as well.  I have not used the espresso portion by itself yet.  Husband bought this maker for me as an early Christmas presents.  I also use creamer for frothing as well. My husband who only occasionally drinks coffee and mainly just cappuccinos out of my Mr. Coffee Keurig was less than pleased with yet another coffee machine.  I made him a latte the other day for the first time and he said that was best coffee he had ever had.  All I can say, that's a miracle in itself.  I love this machine. Follow the direction as noted in the manual.  Especially as others noted that you need to remove the red plastic piece where the water filter is.  Also, please note the cleaning instructions. At first I was overwhelmed with all the pieces and how I would need to clean the frother after each use but honestly it doesn't take much time. This is a great machine for those espresso novices.  Mr. Coffee has made it super easy to make a latte/cappuccino/espresso.",5,2015-10-27,7.0,,,Latte's for the novice,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
5448,1,"My husband bought this cafe barista for me as my anniversary present, so I don’t show that I’m a verified purchase, but my review is genuine, nonetheless.<br /><br />I combed through hundreds of the positive and negative reviews to get tips on using this product correctly. There are some useful tips from other users that definitely helped me. There are some negative reviews that don’t make any sense at all, though.<br /><br />What I took away from a lot of the negative reviews is that people seem to be disappointed in this machine for not functioning as a coffee maker. If you purchase it expecting to make large unattended quantities of coffee like a coffee brewer, you will be disappointed and will think this is a bad product. If you purchase it expecting it to make small-batch, delicious barista-quality espressos, you will be very pleased with it.<br /><br />I started out making the automatic two-shot lattes and cappuccinos but soon realized I was consuming far too much milk product. Using the latte or cappuccino setting will include about 6 ounces of milk. If you have two or three, then before you know it, you’re consuming a gallon of milk in just a few days, which really isn’t healthy. We’re not fond of almond milk or other alternatives, so I needed to find a solution to over-consuming dairy. We love our caffeine, so what I figured out to do is make 4, 2-shot espressos and just put a small amount of creamer in the bottom of a regular coffee cup. I’ve gotten to a science with my process, but it is time-consuming. But the delicious result is very worth my time and effort.<br /><br />If this helps anyone then that’s great. My system for delicious espresso drinks without consuming boatloads of milk or milk alternatives is as follows. Note: I tried using the custom selection of the Espresso selector in an attempt to not have to make so many double shots, but the espresso would taste watery to me.<br /><br />Start with filling the water reservoir:<br />1. Use good quality espresso roast. Any coffee can be used, but if you want barista taste, use the darker roasts. Buy pre-ground, or if you buy whole bean, grind it to the size/consistency of salt granules.<br />2. Fill coffee filter correctly. If you use too much or too little, the shot won’t brew correctly. I fill to just a small mound above the rim of the filter before tamping. This amounts to about one tablespoon per shot.<br />3. Tamp it well. There shouldn’t be any cracks and the coffee grinds should be a smooth surface. It should tamp down to just below the rim of the filter. I hold the filter in my hand because I feel like the plastic could break eventually with the repeated force of tamping it against a countertop.<br />4. Twist filter slowly but firmly into the brewer opening. If it won’t twist all the way to where the handle is straight under the front of the machine, then this means that the filter is too full and the shot won’t brew correctly.<br />5. Position your cup under the brewer opening.<br />6. Press twice on the button of the top Espresso indicator, which will set it to brew a double shot.<br />7. When the shot is brewed and machine stops, remove the cup and set aside on a cup warmer.<br />8. Remove the filter and dump grounds into trash or compost. Rinse it thoroughly under water to clean away used grinds.<br />9. Before brewing the next shot, put another empty cup under the brewer and again press twice on the button of the top Espresso indicator. This is to help rinse away the used grounds from the brewer. If this isn’t done in between brewing shots, your drink won’t be as good-tasting. I also use a wet paper towel to clean the used grounds out of the brewer opening in-between brewing shots.<br />10. Repeat the above steps until you have a full coffee cup.<br /><br />I’ve only been using my barista for about 7 weeks, so there may be cleaning maintenance required that I just haven’t encountered yet due to the short duration that I’ve used it.<br /><br />This may seem like a lot of effort, but I’m a patient person and the result is a truly delicious espresso drink that is of the same high quality as can be obtained at a coffee house, but at a fraction of the cost. I typically pay $6.89 USD at my local grocery store for a pound of ground Starbucks espresso roast. The math at a glance is that at my local Starbucks, a standard venti latte is $5.40 USD. This is just a two or three-shot drink, so the amount of money saved by making them at home is pretty obvious.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy this cafe barista and when using it as intended for small-batch espresso drinks, it is well worth the cost of the machine.",5,2018-05-27,2.0,,,Well worth the comparative low cost,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

I was looking for one that wouldn’t cost too much (dang those things can get expensive!) and would be able to froth milk. This little machine seemed to have everything we needed to fill that missing niche in our kitchen setup.<br /><br />I purchased this from a local home goods store just after Christmas and it has more than paid for itself. My daughter is a Starbucks barista so we are up to our eyeballs in Starbucks coffee beans and since our main machine is a Keurig this Mr. Coffee machine lets us put those beans to good use. There is not a day that passes that we’re not brewing expresso or making a cappuccino with this machine. This brews a nice cup of Espresso (one or two shots), Cappuccino and Lattes. It includes a milk steamer/frother that does a decent job of steaming and frothing. We’ve used it to froth soy milk, coconut milk, whole milk and almond milk. It doesn’t miss a beat.<br /><br />I’m a coffee lover, but not a coffee connoisseur so as long as my coffee tastes good I’m usually happy. Sometimes I want a little something special like a Latte or Cappuccino and other than high calorie powders I was never able to accomplish this at home which meant a trip to Starbucks. Until now...<br /><br />There is only one downside to this machine… it is loud enough to wake the dead! I am not kidding… this thing is LOUD. It’s a trade-off I’m willing to make because I like this machine so much, but if you’re thinking of buying one just be aware of that little downside.<br /><br />We’d never be able to justify the cost of some of the more expensive espresso machines and I’m pleased that Mr. Coffee had this versatile machine on the market geared more toward families like mine… those that love coffee, but are not willing to invest their first born children to do so. I have noticed there’s a huge gap in prices for Espresso machines, you either pay around $200 for an entry level machine or you’re looking at something $400 and up. I did not want to invest that heavily so I kept my eyes at the $200 range. My two main choices were this machine or the Keurig Rivo. Since the Keurig requires specific Espresso pods I decided to try this machine first and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Tip: DO NOT FORGET TO PUT MILK TUBE INTO CUP *BEFORE* FROTHING/STEAMING MILK<br />I did this and oh what a mess it made! I had milk all over the counter, in every nook and cranny of the machine and it was not fun to clean up.

5498,1,"I gave it a shot without getting my expectations too high.  I realize there is a massive disparity between a $60 machine and a $400 machine, but the key things any espresso maker must have, regardless of price point, are that the pump can generate the required pressure to push the water through the grounds and that the water gets hot enough.  Beyond those two things everything else is mostly fluff and preference.  This unit can provide the needed pressure and the water got pretty close to the proper temperature, but it only took one day of use to decide I would be sending this item back for a refund.<br /><br />Here are the items I appreciated about this unit:<br />1. The price is low enough that even if it broke after a year I would feel I got my money's worth<br />2. It comes with a manufacturer's 1 year warranty, and you can get an additional 3 year's of warranty from Amazon for around $8.50 more...which I did.<br />3. Simple to use, easy to remove water tank, minimal cleaning involved.  This really is a minimalistic device.<br />4. It heats up quickly and you can have a hot brew in your hand in around 90-120 seconds from a cold start.  Pretty impressive.<br />5. It produces a respectable espresso and the water temp once it reached the cup was around 180 degrees F.  Ideal brewing temp is around 200 degrees, and I expect to lose some heat during the filtration process, but that's quite a delta between and ideal temp and actual temp.<br /><br />Here are the reasons why I'm sending the unit back:<br />1. Filter basket is very lightweight and fragile.  Looks to be made from aluminum instead of steel, and the plastic handle is very cheaply made.  The lock for the filter (the one used to keep the filter in place when you go to dump out the used grounds) is a complete failure.  It gets in the way when trying to secure the basket to the main unit, and doesn't keep the filter from falling into the garbage when you go to dump out the grounds.  There is also no way to remove the plastic guide in the bottom of the basket (which allows the coffee to drip out of both ports equally) for deep cleaning.  Not sure if it's secured via a tight fit, or if it's glued, but if you can't easily remove it expect to have something nasty start to drip into your coffee after a couple weeks of use. Extremely poor engineering overall for the entire filter assembly.<br />2. The filter basket is not able to be easily locked into place.  I'm a 240lb guy that is used to swinging a hammer and I can barely get this thing all the way into locking position...and doing so I feel like something is going to break (the main unit housing, the handle, or myself).  My 120lb wife can't even come close to getting it into proper position. It was even a challenge to lock it in place with with just the basket...no filter.  Adding the filter and coffee required significant more force to get it into position.<br />3.  There is no auto shutoff for the brewing function.  This is either an unbelievable oversight or a brilliant conception.  Personally I like to push a button and walk away while the machine does the work, knowing how much water needs to be pushed through automatically depending on if I'm wanting one shot or two.  There is no dual-option on this unit.  You're either brewing coffee or your steaming milk.  However with this unit you will need to stand by and watch how much water is passing and then manually shut it off when you think it's enough.  If you walk away and forget about it, the unit will keep going until the reservoir tank runs empty.  Now...if you want to be able to adjust the strength of your coffee by either using less water or more, then you will likely love the manual nature....just don't get distracted while using this or your going to have a massive mess and likely burn out the motor when it continues to run even after the tank runs empty.<br />4.  Plastic, plastic, plastic.  Again...I wasn't expecting much for such a low cost unit, and this is likely a large reason why the cost is what it is, but the smell of hot plastic does not entice the senses.  The housing is plastic, the base is plastic, the heat plate is plastic.  Seriously...the heat plate on top where you warm up your cups is plastic.<br />5. Poor quality control.  While I understand you need to use cheap materials to provide a low entry point product into the coffee market, what's used in this product is simply a too fragile feeling.  However the filter basket was the ultimate dealbreaker.  Without being able to lock into place using a reasonable amount of force, it is mostly unusable for anyone who can't bench press at least 200lbs.",2,2017-06-16,11.0,True,,"For the price and the number of positive reviews it's worth the risk, but keep your expectations low","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

This Mr. Coffee SCMP50 espresso maker had mostly good reviews (especially if you read the ones with tips on how to use for best results); the bad ones focused on  the machine not working from the get-go, or no longer working after a year.  We decided that for the money, this was the machine to try.  Well,...it worked right out of the box and has given us delicious lattes for 4 months.  I have a cup almost every day,...and it is fast and easy to use.  The richness of the coffee is heavenly, and the milk frother works very well.  The water reservoir is a great feature.  I clean up during and after each use and it is easy and quick.  The entire process from putting in the coffee, frothing the milk, dripping the coffee, and then cleaning, takes about 3 minutes.  We love our Mr. Coffee ECMP50.  Now, we only visit Starbucks when we are out of town.  And really, it doesn't taste any better than the lattes we make at home. Spending more on a machine will not necessarily yield better results. At about $70, this machine has proved to be a bargain.",5,2013-10-19,,,,Great Lattes!

We add a level tamped scoop of La LLave and fill a low profile 8 oz.coffee cup about 1/3 to 2/3 full. We add a rounded teaspoon of sugar and add the frothy hot milk. You must use a cappuccino grind as regular coffee blows the water right threw before proper extraction. We have tasted no ""cafe con leche"" or frothy cappuccino better anywhere, at any price. Although the water container is removable, we usually leave it in the machine thereby reducing the wear on the seal. When refilling, be careful not to pour the water on the hinges attached to the cover as water will show up on the counter perhaps leading to claims ""the machine leaks""! (This is very easy to avoid) The steaming process expels excess water in the generous sized drip tray, so empty frequently or else ""the machine leaks"" (the drip tray is full) Please note the yellow sheet (top paragraph) for 1st time priming procedures. The combination coffee scoop/tamper is found on the bottom of the side foam packaging. It's light and could be thrown out unnoticed. To sum it up, you can't buy a better performing machine by spending more, even much more.  We recommend using distilled water or reverse osmosis water for maintenance free use.

You might also give them milk (or have it on hand) so lattes can be had immediately :) I received a grinder and a bag of espresso with my machine (which was awesome), but I bought the frothing pitcher, shot glasses and vanilla syrup soon after.

It has exceeded my expectations in every way. Everything worked perfectly out of the box.<br /><br />The unit warms up in just a couple of minutes and makes nice espresso, assuming you are using a quality coffee to begin with. It produced adequate crema and has low suspended solids, so the portafilter is doing it's job.

Maybe with more experience, I can equal the Italian espresso experience... I think the machine is up to it.<br /><br />The steamer works well for milk steaming and frothing. There may be better on the market, but this one has no obvious shortcomings. Well, maybe one.. the rubber tip of the frothing wand is not easy to remove for cleaning.<br /><br />There is a ""shelf"" on the top which gets warm after 20 minutes or so and is a handy place for the tamper and other items. I suppose it would warm cups, but I'm not patient enough to turn it on a half hour before I need it.<br /><br />It is quiet enough, but being a light weight unit, it vibrates when the pump is running, so you need to hold the cup(s) still while it is brewing.

It doesn't come with a tamper or metal steaming pitcher (as mentioned in other reviews) and hello- those are two rather important aspects of a proper espresso extraction and milk steaming. Sure, you can use a little plastic cup or spice jar, anything round with a flat base and small enough to fit within the filter to compact the grounds... but a heavy metal tamp really works best (30 lbs is the proper/preferred pressure that should be applied to a dosed shot prior to extraction). The instructions tell you to ""gently press down"" using the scoop provided which is just ridiculous, considering it does absolutely nothing. Incase anyone noticed, there are still DRY GROUNDS in the filter basket from your supposedly extracted shot. You don't see them on top when you first look into the filter but go ahead and dump the extracted grounds into your sink and take a look; you'll find perfectly dry, untouched grounds among the wet. So you aren't even getting all that you can from your coffee - its literally being wasted right from the get-go. BIG ISSUE.<br /><br />On to the steam wand - this puppy just simply sucks. You can't use it to steam while brewing/pulling a shot, you have to wait until after its done, then wait for the machine to cool/release pressure because you have to remove the top to add in more water in order to steam. Don't dare try and remove the back cap immediately after brewing or the built-up pressure will spit at you like wildfire and likely scald your hands/arms/etc. due to such high temperature (its hot enough to burn you but is nowhere near a solid 200° where it really should be for optimal extraction).<br /><br />The steam wand comes with a ridiculous rubberized tip on it called a steaming/frothing ""aid"" that doesn't help or aid you in anything whatsoever - just spits the milk up, out and everywhere inbetween. The wand doesn't even begin to exert force or push out steam for a good ten-fifteen seconds, its like you have to wait for the little thing to heat up which is annoying because your so-called shot is siting there getting cold. The pressure isn't strong enough to stretch and airrate the milk, get it to 'whirl pool' when steaming, nor thicken it to proper latter or cappuccino thickness, it just pushes the milk around and adds big bubbles which are exactly what you don't want.<br /><br />One last thing-- to put on and lock the filter and filter holder in place, you have to hold onto the little machine with one hand because it weighs practically nothing and feels incredibly cheap. Looks/design of it are so-so.<br /><br />I know it was a cheapie ($39.00) but was so hopeful that I'd be impressed and proven wrong, especially considering the great reviews but I'm just left annoyed and on the hunt for something that'll live up to my standards without costing an arm and a leg.",3,2012-07-04,,,,Dissatisfied and Decaffeinated,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

It took a while to figure out that all you need to do in order to get a superbly delightful cup every time is to do exactly what the manufacturer recommends. If you don't- THAT'S when you have trouble with the common complaints listed here.<br /><br />Yes- mine leaked at first. It took a while to figure out that I had over ground the beans, and this little steam only machine didn't pack the wallop needed to force the steam through the grind when I did that.<br /><br />If you set the Mr. Coffee grinder to the &#34;fine&#34; setting and shake the grinder every few seconds while it does its thing, the grind comes out a bit coarse compared to most &#34;expresso&#34; grinds. Grinding for an additional 2-3 seconds doesn't hurt, but if you do what I did for the first year or so and over grind the coffee beans till they are powderized like flour, all you'll end up with is a half cup of still nice coffee and a counter covered in hot water.<br /><br />It seems many who have written reviews of the Mr. Coffee products have blamed the machine, and not their own presumtuous ideas about how to use it. It strikes me as odd how there is still this ongoing narrative that anything produced by an American company is inferior to the foreign equivalent. This started with Japanese cars in the 70's when there may have been some truth to the claim, but the fact is that despite having no personal spiritual faith, a great many people these days sure have great faith in foreign manufacturers, even after Honda's recent problem with deadly air bags, or Toyota's accelerator issues.

5613,1,"I bought this machine after spending a large amount of time enjoying coffee bar drinks at the typically hefty price-tag. I was glad to find that I could brew my favorite drink all month for the cost of 6 cups of cappuccino or so at my local coffee store. This machine has a bit of a learning curve, but it is generally simple and works well if you follow instructions meticulously. the most important things I felt should be noted:<br /><br />- A real tamp is CRUCIAL to making good espresso with this machine, but not included.<br />- Same goes for frothing pitcher and a thermometer to know when your steamed milk is ready, ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED.<br />- You should run a full pot of water through before brewing espresso in order to warm the drink.<br />- The pressurized lid can be hard to grip when producing a beverage, especially if you screw it in backwards or &#34;overscrew&#34; the lid. (My biggest complaint, the knobs are simply much too big rounded and clumsy for the size of the actual machine. It does not make sense from a design point of view considering how quickly things need to be engaged in order to pull the best possible beverage.

I read up a bunch on what to buy, with a budget up to $300, and I kept coming back to this Mr. Coffee product.  Yeah, surprised me, too. Just fill it with water, load your espresso (I do the double), turn it on, wait for the lights on the front to go solid, press the café button, and turn the nob on the side to pour out how much you want. I do 2 oz. pull, but you can do more, or you can do less, its up to you. No auto shut off, so you have to stop the pull yourself.  I like that feature. Good and silky coffee cream from the 15 bars of pressure, and it is fast!. Okay, so the residue is a little saucy and not some steamed-out dry puck, but don't listen to the whiners. A quick rinse under the faucet, and voila, all clean!  The only downside is that because it is so light (and certainly no rubber feet would help) you need to hold it when you load and unload your espresso. If it was made of solid stainless and brass and weighed 10lbs+ with rubber feet, then it would be amazing, but of course, it would cost a lot more.

5686,1,"Summary: This espresso maker is simply for the budget minded.  I say that because it doesn't make high quality espresso, BUT it makes it good enough to satisfy most.  The package comes with everything minus the cup, coffee, and water, though I will say the scoop-tamper design is nice for scooping, but doesn't do well as a tamper.  I went out and bought a third party tamper and called it a day.<br /><br />The positives of this unit are the price first and foremost.  It's not too high and the device is pretty reliable.  In addition it's easy to use and steps are easy to understand. And ultimately, it's a pretty quick machine at what it does.  From a cold state, it'll brew 4 shots of espresso in about 5 minutes.<br /><br />The negatives are quite a few...  For starters the unit lacks an auto-off feature.  So you're best to sit close when using it.  The cool-down time is a bit longer than most espresso makers I've used (but for a single user it's not a big deal).  In order to froth milk, you're best to brew first (Even if it's only brewing water) or you'll sit there for quite some time waiting on the water in the reservoir to get hot enough.  The frother is a bit low, to the point where I had to position my machine on the corner of the counter to be able froth with a normal coffee cup.<br /><br />Other notes:  If you buy an after market tamper, don't use too much pressure, the compressed grounds will create a block and pressure will build up and you'll have hot wet grounds spread across your counter-top AND in the water reservoir. The power cord can be a bit short for some, it's just over 12&#34; long.<br /><br />Noted regarding other reviews: I've been using this machine at least 5 days a week for the past 4 months and it's been working just fine for me.  I've had zero issues, aside from the day I compressed the grounds a bit too much with the tamper.<br />The machine is not at all great, but for most it will suffice your desires for espresso.  If you're an espresso enthusiast or you're particular about your espresso, you should avoid this and purchase a real deal espresso maker.",4,2016-01-05,4.0,True,,Inexpensive and easy to use budget espresso maker with frother.,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
5687,1,"If i could rate this higher than 5 stars, I would. I am an entry level espresso drinker. I am switching away from drinking brewing drip coffee in favor of espresso so this machine was a great starter. Out of the box, this machine was super easy to assemble and the instructions were pretty clear on how to prime it. I gave it a quick wipe down before priming just to ensure that it was actually clean.<br /><br />I brew about 6-8 shots of espresso a day; some are straight shots and some are utilizing the cappuccino option. Not once has this thing failed when used correctly. It comes with a list of drinks that you can make that are very simple and not at all daunting to a beginner. The only thing I don't like about this machine is the knob to adjust the foam/steamed milk is fairly unpredictable. The first brew of something after a long while is excessively foamy regardless of the selector being all the way to the left (latte.) After that first brew though its pretty consistent. Additionally, I would advise a better tamper (thing that you use to press the espresso down) the perfect size would be a 51mm. For a beginner, I HIGHLY recommend this machine.

5688,1,"We bought this back in February, and it was terrific for about the first six months. It made some of the best coffee either my wife or I ever had, the foaming function worked really well. If not for the following, we'd give it four or five stars.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />In September, it stopped working properly. One of the neat things about it is that it will automatically brew one or two shots of espresso, as well as as much as you want, up to about a full 8 oz. cup. Well, it is neat until that's the ONLY thing it will do, regardless of whether you pick one or two shots. It made a lot of messes, and it was still under warranty, so we called Mr. Coffee (Jarden Customer Service), and they said all they needed was a proof of purchase and they'd send us a new one, no problem. They didn't even want the old one back.<br /><br />Except it was a problem. I called them a few days after we sent them the Amazon invoice, they said they never received it. So we sent it again. And Again. Each time, we asked them to include some kind of acknowledgement that they received the email, and we heard nothing. Finally, I wrote them a fourth email nearly a month after we'd originally sent the invoice telling them that we'd sent the invoice to them several times and had heard nothing from them, and we needed to know what was going on. It was about this time they responded to our FIRST email--the one they said they never got--and said that the replacement was on its way.<br /><br />We got that one early this month (October), and it worked well--until a couple of days ago; now it simply will not turn on at all. So, call Jarden Customer Service again.<br /><br />Now, they want us to ship the now-defective replacement with a shipping label that will be emailed to me...in 3-5 weeks, because of the system they use (for what it's worth, the woman I talked to seemed to sympathize with me on how ridiculous this system is). Once I get that label around Thanksgiving, I should call them after 24 hours after we ship it so they can put it into their system. Then, presumably, they'll start the process of shipping us a replacement machine that will no doubt arrive around April Fool's Day, because why not, and will operate, if the trend holds, for approximately 27:45.<br /><br />I'll consider revising my review depending on how they resolve this, but right now the fact of the matter is that product doesn't last, and Mr. Coffee / Jarden is completely indifferent to taking care of their customers.

5689,1,"All I can say is WOW. Now, that's a cup of java! I'm impressed. I was hoping it would live up to the positive reviews; I wasn't disappointed. The frother works way better than I had expected. As another reviewer had strongly recommend, I primed and then cleaned the system with 1/2 tank straight white vinegar followed by flushing with a full tank clean water before the first use to assure all manufacturing lubricants and impurities were properly removed to achieve the best quality brew possible. I did invest in some high quality beans (Lavazza Espresso Super Crema) as well as a metal temper and ground my beans fresh with a decent coffee grinder I already owned. The results were wonderful. I had to experiment to find the right balance of espresso and cappuccino that  gave me  the strength and body I was looking for but once accomplished, just add syrup, sweetener,  and/or the extract flavoring  of your choice and you have a coffee drink that rivals Starbucks (at a fraction of the price!). Yum. The automatic clean cycle also makes clean up pretty easy and quick.  The unit is fairly simple to operate and doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out. Goodbye plain ol' cup of joe, hello smooth, yummy coffee house creation! My only gripe with this unit is the ridiculously short power cord. I had to use an extension cord to reach a nearby outlet.

(The grind is important for espresso quality)<br /><br />Brew as much or little as you like, hand controlled shot allows you to stop brewing when your ready to increase or decrease strength overall.<br /><br />My tips for using this machine is to go online and watch a review.  Don't over pack your coffee puck, think lighter pack.  This has caused some people to complain in the past.  I have had no issues of a bad shot due to under or over packing so far.<br /><br />Frothing milk, first and foremost, remove the little rubber thing on the steam tube, you can't get a good froth with that thing, plus it's harder to clean.  It will go back on but it's hard to get there, so plan on leaving it off.  This aids in cleaning the tube with a hot rag after steaming.<br /><br />Remember to remove the little tray and rinse after use, some steam may be released into this pan after use to relieve pressure from the unit.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />Heats up fast<br />Takes little room on counter overall, with storage for cups and accessories on top of machine<br />Pulls good shots for average coffee connoisseur and makes a good froth<br />large reservoir holds enough water for several uses<br />Well known brand and available at many retailers<br />15 bar pump (rare in this price range)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Some cleaning required after use (this is anything right?)<br />Doesn't hold as much coffee as more professional machines so strength may not be acceptable for the pro's<br /><br />Overall impression.

5691,1,"Very nice device as long as you keep in mind the price range and what you should use it for. For beginners, don't get too caught up in the snobbery of it all. I used fresh beans + burr grinder as normal and got a good shot, and used scissors to cut open a Kcup and used those grounds and thought it tasted even better.<br /><br />As long as you use this to make the right thing, you'll be very happy. The way I use it is as follows: put a half spoon of creamer in a small espresso teacup, and pull the shot and enjoy the nice little cuban coffee type drink, and it tastes amazing. However, since the espresso it makes isn't super boiling temp, if you try to make starbucks type lattes you'll be disappointed with the taste (it'll be lukewarm.) This is due to one thing- the milk frother is awful. I avoid using it.<br /><br />Cons: portafilter twist requires superhuman strength to twist fully, so I just twist only halfway and it remains perfectly tight and fine. Feels very plasticky and moves on counter easily.<br /><br />Overall: makes a good, buzzy shot of espresso quickly and easily.

5718,1,"i am writing this as i sip on my earl-grey-steam i somewhat cautiously made with my mr. coffee espresso machine, and overall i must say i am impressed. judging from previous reviews, this product is something you will either love for the reasonable price or hate because it just straight-up exploded in your face.  take my review with a grain of salt, as i have yet to actually make an espresso yet so i can't comment on the flavor of espresso it produces  (haven't had a chance to go to the store), but i have run water through the machine for my tea and i have used the steaming wand to froth milk for my steamers.  so far i have had a very pleasant first impression with this little machine.  though it doesn't swivel like the one i used to use as a barista, the steaming wand is easy to use, strong, and is capable of producing very frothy milk if that is what you're after-perfect for dry capps. i didn't bother buying a stainless steel pitcher to steam my milk in and instead just steam it right in my coffee mug before adding my tea, which i would recommend doing in order to save yourself $10.  also, because the steaming wand is so short i imagine one could potentially have an issue getting it to reach the milk in the bottom of a normal pitcher anyways. it is extremely lightweight, which could be taken as a pro or con, though personally i would prefer something that feels a little bit sturdier. initially i was terrified to use this machine after reading reviews saying their machine literally exploded in front of them, sending shards of glass flying (it seems that the pressure from the machine propels a tray from behind the pitcher out, causing the pitcher to violently shatter). this could be due to loose/cheaps screws used to hold the machine together, or because the pressure has not been properly released after each use. but as they say, an ounce of protection equals a pound of care, so i never stand directly in front of the machine while it's plugged in. oh, the things we do for caffiene. :)",5,2014-10-24,,True,,"Caffiene is love, caffiene is life.","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

5734,1,"I got mine back in July 2014. What prompted me to write a review is because it starts to lose its pressure after 1 year of light use.<br />It was the cheapest automatic espresso+froth maker in the market, and it worked great!<br />It was very easy to use. Just put milk in the milk reservoir, pack the coffee in the espresso portafilter, with a press of button, you'll get a cup of espresso drink as good as Starbucks can make. (still a distance away from some finer coffee shop, in my opinion.)<br />It's easy to clean, too. After you are done, just load the mile reservoir with water and it'll clean itself.<br /><br />We regularly make a cup or two everyday for the last year. Recently we noticed after making espresso, water remains trapped in portafilter. Usually it will be really hot and dry as the hot steam pushes all the water out. It is the first sign we noticed about the machine losing pressure. Then soon after we start see the milk frother &#34;getting stuck&#34;, which you can hear the pump attempting to draw milk and froth it but nothing coming out. At this point we have to prime the machine with water first to get the pressure up and prime the internal parts to get the milk froth.<br /><br />We are pretty good at running water through after using the machine, so it may be more than just having buildups in the tubing inside.<br />We still use it but just less frequent due to the hassle of priming and cleaning and the mediocre coffee it makes now.<br />I guess now the question is if this machine last 1 year and the more expensive machine with 5x the price last 5 years, which one should you get?",3,2015-06-15,,True,,"Great for the first year, now it's just ok.","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

Luckily, I felt like trying the machine fully tonight and thus I was going to make a cappuccino.  I followed all the instructions, however, once I got to the part where the milk is supposed to froth into the cup, to my surprise...it never did.  I re-read the instructions and noted that I followed everything.  I even chose to just do froth again manually to see if I could get something to come out, but at last no avail.  My cup was froth milkless.  I went onto the Mr. Coffee product support and looked it up there and there was still no answer, it was basically the instructional booklet all over again.  Myself being an engineer decided to take a step back and look for something missing.  And then it hit me, there was no straw for the milk to be pulled up into, luckily I had not thrown that piece away.  In shipping they had installed the piece into the metal piece that the milk comes out, I had originally thought it was an extra guide for the milk, but before I had received the machine I had watched a couple of videos on it and noted that the straw was not used there.  I then took the straw and inserted it into the bottom of the cap where the milk is stored, hit the froth manually again, and wallah frothed milk came out.  So please note to NOT throw that piece away if it is not installed where it should be, the instructions never tell you to install it.<br />I gave the machine 5 stars because the machine worked perfectly and its nice that I don't have to manually froth my milk.

I read the reviews carefully, and was very glad I did. Read The Rancher's Wife's review. It is what sold me on this machine. I followed her instructions exactly, including cleaning it with vinegar before using it the first time, which is not in the instruction manual. She called the company when she wasn't getting the performance she wanted from her new machine, and they told her to do the vinegar wash right away. Too bad that isn't in the instructions in priming the unit. I could tell that it was taking longer to produce a cup after the vinegar cleaning. This is GOOD! It means it was heating better. Go to her review for why that is important.<br /><br />So after doing the vinegar clean and then making sure I had all of the vinegar residue gone, I FINALLY made my first cup. Absolutely fantastic!

5770,1,"I recently purchased the ECMP50 and have been playing with it for only a few days. I've been very pleased with the espresso it makes, though I wish the unit was a little taller with a longer steam wand, so as to better fit the frothing pitcher I already had. At a mere 4"" tall, my current pitcher is too deep for the steam wand to reach deep enough to properly heat the milk. A minor inconvenience for now.<br /><br />However, this review is about ""the leak"". A lot of reviewers here have reported having leakage problems. Right out of the box, I, too, experienced water leaking from the unit. For the record, the leakage is not from an overflowing drip pan (as some non-leakers have implied) Rather the leaking is coming from the point where the valve assembly of the water tank fits into the base of the machine. Picture a plug fitting into a hole. The ""hole"" has an o-ring which is intended to seal around the ""plug"" of the water tank as it fits down into the machine.<br /><br />When the tank is seated into the machine, the valve is always open, in order to feed the machine water as needed. Unfortunately, the o-ring lining the hole does not seem to seal well enough as to keep water inside the machine from draining back out once brewing and steaming has ended and you've turned-off the machine. The result is that water leaks back past the o-ring and out between the water tank and the seat it sits on. The water ends up spilling out between the two and onto your countertop (and under the machine itself, which can be mistaken for water leaking out of the bottom itself.)<br /><br />I have tried a very simple (and cheap) fix which, so far, seems to be working to keep the machine from leaking. I went to my local hardware store and got a container of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plumber-s-Silicone-Grease/dp/B0009PY4OE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plumber's Silicone Grease</a>. It's non-toxic and can be used in places where it might come into contact with drinking water. All I did was smear a small dab of the stuff over the o-ring in the hole of the base of the machine. You don't have to glob it on. Just a light smear.<br /><br />So far, this seems to have cured my leaking problem (of course, as soon as I post this review, my countertop will be flooded.)",4,2010-05-08,7.0,True,,For those experiencing the leak...,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

Nice racket.<br />=====================<br />I got this to replace a leaking Krups machine which is very similar in appearance.  This is cheaper at this point on Amazon.  The Krups machine is no longer sold by Amazon; it was a $50-$60 machine and now it's being sold for the absurdly profiteering price of $300 for anyone foolish enough to think they will get what they pay for at that price.<br />Anyhow, the Mr. Coffee (made by Sunbeam, by the way).

I mean, it's supposed to work, right?<br />Good parts of the design;<br />--Knobs are shaped so they are very easy to turn, which is good.<br />--There is a sort of bobbin to wind excess electrical cord underneath, which is good.<br />Bad parts of the design:<br />--Filler cap has a cool tapered shape, which of course makes it impossible to get a grip on it and lift it if your hands are wet (which often is the case in kitchen and food prep situations).<br />--Partly due to cool tapered shape, the filler cap can easily be cross threaded, or it can slip into the surrounding recessed area (which is also very cool design) and it can get stuck in there.<br />--Note to design staff: form follows function.  Or it should.  Cool is not always functional.<br />--Unlike all other espresso machines like this that I've owned, the metal filter is just sitting in the holder, with nothing to keep it from falling out.  So when you go to knock the &#34;puck&#34; out into the trash after you make coffee, the whole metal filter also will fall out into the trash every time, so you will have to fish it out.  And of course if it's hot you will burn your hand.  STUPID design flaw.  (Solution: knock it out into a plastic cup, but of course it's still hot so you have that to deal with.)<br />--Cord is very short.<br />This is probably worth the ~$40 I paid for it, but no way is it worth the $88 original indicated price.

5913,1,The milk will froth just fine you fill the froth cup half way with milk and then stick the stem up in the milk. After that turn the knob slowly untill it stops.  Then you want to line up the top of the milk with two tiny hols in the stem. Alow the milk to slowly push through the holes.  If it's not right in the perfect spot you will get a bubbly mess of hell. Watch closely and it will start to flow into the holes and gradually froth the hell out of the milk.  I froth till it reaches the top then slowly pour the steamed milk in and spoon out about a half inch of froth. Only use 1% or skim milk and to add a tad of flavor add a flavored coffee creamer to the milk. I use about 1/8th of the am out of milk I use.  My bad problem is the directions suck and it's really hard to get the froth stem clean because the milk cakes to the inner metal stem. Also manual says nothing is dishwasher safe so I just hand wash now. I also wish there was a water level indicator.

You have to make sure you take the plastic piece off to clean the milk from the metal pipe. This is a HUGE design flaw.

5926,1,"I really wanted to get into making espresso at home as I always found myself going to Starbucks or other local coffee places multiple times every week. I investigated buying an Illy Pod machine, however when I went to visit a friend in L.A. she has this exact machine and made me some espresso and it was wonderful. So instead of spending $150+ on a pod machine or a super fancy machine I decided to give this little guy a chance since she loved hers so much. I am glad I did an I will tell you why:<br /><br />Design:<br />This is a really nicely designed espresso machine, it is small, simple, and overall looks nice sitting on the counter. It isn't fancy as it just has a turn nob to make espresso or use the steamer. The top of the machine can be used to hold anything, I put a few small espresso cups on top and it looks nice.<br /><br />Ease of use:<br />It really doesn't get any easier than this to make espresso. Simply fill the water up to the 2 or 4 (cup) line and pour into the top, and pack the espresso into the holder up to 2 or 4. The espresso holder simply lifts and locks into place. Turn the nob and it will start brewing, and once you no longer see espresso coming out you can turn it off.<br /><br />Espresso:<br />I have used Fresh & Easy Espresso and also Lavazza espresso and it tastes great with this machine. I mix mine with a bit of soy half and half and I am good to go, or throw hot water in for an americano. Many people rate the espresso machine based on it's ability to make that nice froth on top of the espresso and you will see a bit here when you make the coffee. It is complete steam based system and it seems to work fairly well. The froth on top of the espresso isn't extremely thick and I am assuming higher end machines will do this better. I will say that once I bought a Tamper to pack down the espresso it helped a lot, so invest another $6 or so to get one of these and it will make a pretty decent difference, if not just for the ease of use.<br /><br />Frother:<br />On the side of the machine is a milk frother/steamer. I didn't read the directions so I honestly didn't know how to use it until my friend from L.A. came to visit. All you have to do is add water to the little steam icon on the cup and pour it into the machine. Then turn it on and give it a minute. The steam is hot and pretty intense. It actually does a nice job of frothing milk or soy as long as you figure out how to use it. TIP: I like to turn the machine onto Brew after I am done frothing as there might be some water left over.<br /><br />Summary:<br />This machine by far is the best bang for the buck. I have had it for around 2 months, and my friend has had it for a year and it is great. I still occasionally go to Starbucks, but it is great to just have it available right in my house. For $30 definitely give this little guy a try.",5,2010-12-13,3.0,True,,Great beginner espresso machine,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

5928,1,"Let me start by saying that I am not a coffee drinker, and much less an espresso drinker. As such, prior to ten days ago, I knew just about nothing regarding espresso machines. However, my daughter's birthday was coming up; and being as she is a former barista who obviously enjoys drinking her espressos, I wanted to give her something nice which I knew she would appreciate.<br /><br />After a fair amount of research on the web -- Wikipedia, Amazon, etc. -- and being as I am an elderly man who lives on a fixed income, I settled for this Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine.<br /><br />Naturally, my daughter was quite happy to receive this gift from me, and we have both enjoyed a few espressos made with it. However, yesterday, while I was in her kitchen, I noticed that the top of this machine was off. Upon looking in, I was really taken back to discover that the boiler is actually made of aluminum, and not stainless steel.<br /><br />For those of you who are reading this who may be young, the reason for my concern and alarm is that for decades now, a debate has raged regarding the safety of using aluminum in cooking utensils, such as pots and pans. If you conduct your own personal research, you will quickly discover that there is a wide diversity of opinions on both sides of the fence. What is stated as truth and fact depends on who is making the statements: scientists, medical professionals, beverage industry reps, manufacturers of such items as this one, etc. Who you choose to believe is really up to you.<br /><br />Be that as it may, just the fact that high ingestion of aluminum has been potentially linked to maladies such as Alzheimer's Disease, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, etc., by certain parties, was enough to convince me to abandon aluminum cookware many years ago.<br /><br />Thus, my concern with this espresso machine. If just boiling hot water in an aluminum pot or tea pot results in a small amount of aluminum being dissolved into the liquid, I can only wonder how truly safe it is to boil water under high pressure in an espresso machine which has an aluminum boiler, such as this one.<br /><br />While others may disagree with me -- that is your right -- quite frankly, I feel that listing &#34;stainless steel&#34; as one of the selling points for this espresso machine is misleading, deceptive, and borders on false advertising. Yes, some of the outer parts are in fact stainless steel. However, the most important part -- the boiler -- most certainly is not.<br /><br />For those of you who may doubt my words, I got the truth straight out of the horse's mouth; that is, from the Mr. Coffee support team themselves. In the question and answer section of their website at http://www.mrcoffee.com/specialty/mr.-coffee-steam-espresso-and-cappuccino-maker--ecm160-np-/ECM160-NP.html, one person asks:<br /><br />Q: &#34;Is there any aluminum used in this machine or is it stainless steel?&#34;<br /><br />A: &#34;The water boiler portion of the brewer is aluminum. All other metal parts of the brewer are stainless steel.&#34;<br /><br />Another concerned person asks:<br /><br />Q: &#34;How much aluminum is leached into the water that I am consuming. Why did they not put stainless steel inside instead?&#34;<br /><br />A: &#34;At Jarden Consumer Solutions (JCS), we are committed to producing trusted household products that meet or exceed applicable product standards. All aluminum used in the Mr. Coffee Espresso Maker are recognized as safe for food contact applications by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). JCS purchases aluminum from trusted suppliers, who monitor to ensure what they sell complies with all current federal, state and local health and safety regulations.&#34;<br /><br />Please notice that Mr. Coffee did not directly answer either of the person's two questions.<br /><br />The bottom line is that you get what you pay for. I bought cheap because that is all my finances allowed, and I am now left disappointed. I love my daughter, and her health is of great concern to me. Thus, I just purchased her another espresso machine which costs five times as much as this one; and yes, it has a stainless steel boiler.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are ignorant regarding espresso machines as I was, or if you are on a limited budget, you may be happy with this espresso machine. However, if you are concerned for your health, you may want to consider spending more money, and at least getting something that has a stainless steel boiler.<br /><br />PS: Also worthy of note is the following information regarding the Mr. Coffee Espresso Machine which is also found on the Mr. Coffee website:<br /><br />&#34;The ECM160 espresso maker has a maximum pressure of: 1.24 bar with 14g of coffee powder 3.62 bar with 24g of coffee powder.&#34;<br /><br />From what I have read online, and based on what my barista daughter told me as well, by any standard, that is TERRIBLE pressure, and will NOT deliver a very strong/concentrated shot of espresso. It is substandard. For a decent shot, your espresso machine should produce at least pressure of 15 bar. Such machines cost at least a few hundred dollars . . . such as the new one that I just purchased for my daughter to replace the Mr. Coffee machine; that is, this one:<br /><br /><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DeLonghi-EC702-15-Bar-Pump-Espresso-Maker-Stainless/dp/B001CNG7RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DeLonghi EC702 15-Bar-Pump Espresso Maker, Stainless</a>",3,2015-09-27,25.0,True,,"Beware!

But that's part of why Amazon is so great, b/c I could file the exchange claim and have another one in the mail, ASAP. And the second one works fine. If I wasn't so cheesed off about getting a faulty first unit I'd be giving this a higher score.<br /><br />And yes, I took the orange thing out of the reservoir the first time. It was impossible to miss; they must have added more stickers to the packaging to make sure that doesn't happen based on all the reviews. The first machine wouldn't prime at all, just clicked a little then started blinking at me. After about 30 minutes of desperately hoping things would start working I gave up and put it back in the box. A few days later I tried again with the new one and things worked fine. Hopefully they stay that way for a long time.<br /><br />I got this as a gift for my wife since a milk reservoir might save a few steps in her coffee routine. We'd seen way more expensive versions of the same thing and always said they were out of our budget. This is definitely not, but it brews very nice espressos and is pretty quick about it too.

I fill the pitcher up just about 1/2 way and when I steam the milk, I get so much froth it almost overflows! The key to small frothy bubbles is to keep the steam handle fully emersed in the milk. To have enough steam you need to add about 2 to 3 ounces extra water to the water reservoir (if making 4 cups I usually fill the espresso pitcher to the top of the metal band). When the espresso has brewed the requested # of cups simply switch the power to steam from brew (less mess if the frothing arm is in the pitcher ready to go when you do this).<br /><br />If you follow the directions, clean after each use (Especially the frothing arm...immerse in water and run a small steam cycle after each use and scrub with a scrubbing sponge), and this will be a great addition to your kitchen for a long time!

5948,1,"This is a very disappointing purchase and I do NOT recommend at all. As other reviewers have noted, the coffee produced is a VERY STRONG DRIP COFFEE, NOT ESPRESSO. It is acceptable to drink as long as you don't try to think of it as true espresso. The picture is for marketing purposes and not an accurate representation. The ""frother"" is a disaster. It does steam but does not froth the milk no matter which method you use including the booklet's minimal instructions. I used a frothing pitcher, the recommended 2% milk, moved the pitcher in the right direction (both circular and vertical) but GOT ONLY STEAMED MILK, NO FROTH. The frothing wand of the machine also has a tendency to spit the milk upward making a mess. I don't need to start my day with these hassles and still not get espresso and frothed milk. Also mentioned by another reviewer is the design. It's definitely a case of design for eye appeal not utility -- form over function. Despite the appearance of metal, it is made of CHEAP PLASTIC. Look closely at the on/off knob and water compartment cap. That sloping contour is extremely smooth with no surface variation making it VERY DIFFICULT TO GRIP OR TURN. If you have any grip problems with your hands or weakness in your fingers, it's nearly impossible to turn either of these. I'm not a newbie to espresso machines or to frothing the milk. I've had positive experience with another brand machines (no longer made) that is in the same price range. Unfortunately, the company doesn't make the lower $$ machines anymore. I may have to reach deeper into my wallet to buy a better espresso unit but it won't be Mr. Coffee brand (I still like their drip machines though). The reviews here on the Mr Coffee ECM160 4 cup Steam Espresso Machine were mostly positive which is why I bought the machine. In the end, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND it for anyone else and I regret my purchase. I'm returning it if permitted.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon rules do not permit the return of this unit because it is now used and not new. I wanted to clarify also that extreme caution should be used when using the ""frothing"" feature. When we were using it, part of the spitting I mentioned resulted in droplets of steamed milk landing on the hand holding the pitcher. Your immediate reaction is of course to let go of the pitcher which would only cause greater problems spilling out steaming hot milk.

5952,1,"I've purchased many espresso makers. Most the old steam variety. You don't really know espresso until you have used a pump machine. My first pump machine was a complete disaster (I won't name the brand but it has the same initials as myself). It failed continually because the basket had a rubber gasket and coffee would get into it. Ugh.<br />I was happy when I bought the Mr. Coffee Barista because the baskets are all metal. They don't lose pressure because of coffee getting under the rubber, although they will clog if you use unevenly ground coffee. If that happens you can buy replacement baskets at a very reasonable price from many vendors.<br />Even better! No mud!! Yes, if you are a former steam espresso user you are accustom to a dry solid brick of used coffee grounds that you can easily dump in the trash. Not the case with pump machines, they leave you with a puddle of mud because instead of dry steam the coffee is pushed through hot water. Except for this espresso machine. Why? Well it has an auto-off feature that turns the power off after about 15 minutes after use. The result of that is, it continues to heat the basket for a while and that dries out the grounds, so they can easily be scraped out. Not as nice as the solid hockey puck that you get from a steam espresso maker, but still not mud! So much nicer than other machines that leave you with a basket of mud the next time you use it!<br />That alone makes this espresso machine a great deal!<br />So get over the low brow name brand (I was able to rub it off mine).

5955,1,"I should start this review with the headstone:  RIP Born, January 2014, Died August 2015.  I am torn about the stars - when it worked, it did a decent job of automatic cappuccino creation as long as you are not a perfectionist/barista etc.  It is BY FAR the lowest priced, non pod based semi-automatic cappuccino maker.  If you buy pre-ground (I used Bustello) or have a grinder (which I used for decaff espresso), and buy a decent tamper - it is a great quick cup of basically ok espresso or cappuccino.  It is not going to approach a true coffee house version of those drinks, but it is also not 2K dollars.  I used it about once a day - so lets say it did about 500 cups before it gave up the ghost.  By my calculations, that is about 35-40cents a cup, not including the coffee and milk.  I figure the coffee was about 10 cents a cup, and milk probably 5cents, so all in this was costing me in 50-60 cents range.  Not bad per se.<br /><br />My issue is that about 1year in, of course right about the time warranty expired, it started having trouble frothing the milk.  I performed regular cleaning as per recommendations.  It became very sensitive to the milk (temperature, freshness).  About a week ago, I turned it on and the pump would not shut off.  RIP.  I think these things should last 3 years.  At 3 years the cost per cup is in the 15 cent range.

5957,1,"I'd bought this at Walmart but Amazon is the first place I go for reviews before purchasing a product so I figured I'd put my two cents for this item.<br /><br />Quick review: steamer attachment doesn't warm the milk, only froths so the milk needs to be heated before. There was no tamper so the espresso grounds don't get pressed well.<br /><br />I was a barista for over a year, an avid coffee drinker since my early teens, and I've had espresso machines in the past. My last machine broke and I got a keurig that just wasn't working for me....spending $6 daily on my 4 shot lattes is ridiculous when I know how to make them so I bought this after a recommendation.<br /><br />For me personally the machine is okay because I drink lattes over ice. I do need to plug the machine in and turn on the brew just a little for about 10 minutes before it is hot enough to actually brew.<br /><br />The steamer doesn't get hot! I've waited and waited leaving the machine on but the little frothed does not heat the milk so when I do make hot lattes I heat the milk in the microwave before frothing.<br /><br />I know this was the cheap machine but other Mr. Coffee products have a tamper attached to the scoop, cheap but works. This machine does NOT have a tamper! Also, the filter doesn't actually lock so each time you empty the grounds you needs to wait for it to cool then take the filter out which is sort of inconvenient.<br /><br />With the additional purchase of a tamper that actually fits the filter as well as the steamer that doesn't work, I don't feel like this machine is work the money.

I don't think you get much more before you spend around 500. I grew up with a commercial machine in my house, and I've been contemplating getting one for us now, but I didn't want to spend the 500 dollars on a good machine until I figured out what I wanted out of a machine. And that's really where this model stands out.<br /><br />It's cheap enough to last you a year until you're ready to upgrade, but its good enough that you aren't going to &#34;outgrow&#34; it or crave something better right away either. Its a good machine for what it is. Most espresso machines at this price range and higher are pressurized baskets. If you don't know what that is, its basically just a basket that you put the coffee in that maintains pressure so that if your grinds aren't good, or you don't know how to tamp the basket, it'll still make a pretty good shot of espresso. I recommend getting an unpressurized basket though, as you have much more flexibility. Don't skimp on your grinder! You're better off spending 200 on a grinder and 70 on an espresso maker, instead of the opposite. But if you want to try owning an espresso machine, this one won't let you down.

It can be fun to play with, but it is for coffee dilettantes, not coffee snobs.<br /><br />Here are a few tips I have picked up from daily practice and from other reviewers:<br /><br />1.  Yes, there is a distinct metallic tinge- it reminded me of a clothes steamer I used to have, and I think it comes from the heating element, not plastic parts.  This DOES go away.<br /><br />2.  The flat end of the scoop make a very bad tamper, but you do not need to buy a tamper as an accessory.  I have been using a teaspoon.<br /><br />3.  The best word in the entire instruction manual?  &#34;ceramic.&#34;  As in 'stainless steel or ceramic pitcher.'  If you have a 16 oz. ceramic mug, you do not need to get a stainless steel pitcher.<br /><br />4.  The best drink you can make using this machine is one double latte.  Make a double espresso, steam 8 oz. of milk in a 16 oz. pitcher or mug, pour your espresso into a glass or mug, top it with the milk- THEN put the carafe back and make a 'bad brew' expelling the extra hot water. Do not drink this coffee- give it to your mother-in-law... (Just Kidding!)<br /><br />Expelling the extra water is a very good tip I picked up from an early review.  If you think of the reservoir as your 'kettle,' then you know fresh cold water is always the best thing to start with... but now I think I've given away my tea-drinking past.<br /><br />A great birthday present..

5992,1,"I purchased this unit  about a week ago and I decided to write a review that targets a very specific audience.<br /><br />If you really enjoy Espresso, Cappuccino or even a Latte and you don't like having to pay the high cost of purchasing them from your local coffee shop...AND if you don't have a lot of money to invest in equipment...then this review was written for you.<br /><br />For the money...you will not find a better Espresso machine out there.  This is by far the best value on the market as of today (12/2012).<br />I started off with an Aeropress and a hand powered burr grinder from Kyocera that made a very very good substitute for Espresso.  And my wife and I were very happy with that system.  But we found that the time involved kept us from enjoying our morning Espresso as often as we would have liked and I ended up going out pretty often to a local shop when I felt the need.<br /><br />So I began reading reviews online, watching youtube videos and talking to folks to see what my options were.  I was pretty pleased to find out that I did have an affordable option available to me..and so I took the plunge.<br /><br />From Amazon I purchased a Baratza Encore grinder ($130), Mr. Coffee ECMP50 ($80), and an Espresso Tamper.  I already had an Aerolatte milk frother (Highly recommended).<br /><br />The combination of this equipment produces an outstanding result that is better than a lot of local shops in my area...and probably yours too!  If you can afford to spend $250 then THIS is the way to go...and I can assure you that you will not be disappointed in the result.<br /><br />Go out to a local coffee roaster and get a recommended Espresso blend whole bean (FRESH is BEST).  Grind it in the Baratza Encore at the 9 setting for the Mr. Coffee ECMP50 and follow the directions to produce the Espresso.  Pour milk into your coffee cup and get it hot in the microwave....then use the Aerolatte milk frother to almost double it in volume.  Add your flavorings and sweetener as desired and then pour the Expresso into it to enjoy a WONDERFUL treat.<br /><br />Now think about it...if you just spend $4 per drink and buy just 2 per week (1 for you and 1 for your wife) you will spend $416 per year.  With the system above you can produce two drinks EVERY DAY for less than $600 for the YEAR (INCLUDING THE COST OF COFFEE BEANS and MILK!)  And even if you have to replace the Mr. Coffee every year....you still come out on top of the deal!<br />So you get 7X the coffee at just a little bit more cost than going to a local shop for just 1 per week.  How can you beat that deal?<br /><br />Having said all this I again HIGHLY RECOMMEND this system for those who can spend $250 on their equipment and who love Espresso/Cappuccino/Latte drinks.  You will NOT be disappointed, I promise you.  Life is too short to not enjoy a good Espresso/Cappuccino/Latte...and the economy is too bad to go to your local shop on a regular basis.  So make the plunge now and give YOURSELF a present that you will enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />*** 1 Month update ****<br />Everything is still going strong and I have had ZERO problems.  The one thing that I now realize is that I should have taken into account the cost associated with cleaning the grinder and Espresso Maker.  There are a few options that you can run through your grinder to clean the parts that are not designed to be easily removed for cleaning...but I have not chosen one for recommendation yet.  Once I do, I will refactor the the costs shown above and amend them.  The cost of cleaning the Espresso machine can be mitigated by using quality water and following the cleaning recommendations in the manual.<br />I do not expect for the additional cost of cleaning to significantly reduce the value....but it is something that should be taken into consideration, as proper cleaning will increase the life span of your equipment and therefore reduce the cost per serving over the performance period.<br /><br />*** 10 Month update ***<br />Well, we have been using this machine for almost a year now and it is going strong.  I just cleaned it for the first time to get ready for the fall, when our latte drinking increases.<br />I still highly recommend this machine if you are looking for something in the sub $300 range.  Save your money for a good grinder and go with this machine.  Quality ingredients, good water, and investing in a good grinder and you are all set to save big $$ while making drinks better than you can buy at Starbucks!<br /><br />**** 32 Month update ****<br />This machine is still are big part of our family routine...and is going strong.  I have heard of folks who have had issues with this machine, but can attest that mine is still working great.  Again, maintenance is a big part of ensuring that the system operates trouble free.  AND, using good quality water.  It is easier to NOT gum up the machine, than to have to descale it constantly!<br /><br />While this has been a staple in my home, I am now making the plunge into a more expensive espresso maker.  Having gone from prepping for 1 - 2 frequently during the week to 3 every single day, I feel that I can justify the expense of a step up machine that is designed to take that kind of production.  But I will always remember this machine, like a first love, it go me though my initial exploration into the wonderful world of espresso.

6021,1,"Ok...so, i'll admit that I am very grumpy right now, because it's early, and I have 3 small kids making lots of noise, and I need my coffee, and don't have any right now, even though my Mr. Coffee machine is staring at me from the kitchen counter, reminding me that if I am desperate enough, I can brew, but I know that if I do, it will be the most awful tasting coffee I've ever made. My first machine lasted about a year, when it seemed to stop brewing correctly after a year. The second machine lasted for less than 6 months before the taste of the coffee changed to awful. We have hard water, so I figured it was my fault and should just clean it more often. I ordered another one. This time I was meticulous with the cleaning and schedule, but it didn't matter; 5 months later, the coffee is undrinkable again. It's not the water, the coffee, or the method, since it brewed perfect delicious tasting coffee for the first 4 months. It's just the lifespan of the machine. Yes...the machine is cheap. But it's expensive when you have to buy more than 2 in a year. So I end this review with disclosing the fact, that yes! I am bitter and grumpy and angry, but I am about to load the car up with 3 wild kids who are young enough to still be in car seats, and I wouldn't have to do this if my MR.

6028,1,"I received this for Christmas from my loving wife who noticed a slight cloud over my weekends since my espresso maker went out several months ago.  I had the Mr. Coffee model previous to this one.  It served me well for over a year with regular use before I learned the hard way about not overpacking the grounds.<br /><br />After taking this one around the block a few times I have to say I'm extremely impressed with the design improvements they've made.  Overall, this machine is a tremendous value for under $100 (mine was $75 on sale).  You would really have to be a coffee snob (and have a lot of disposable income) not to love what you get for the money (I'm a poor coffee snob.)<br /><br />To sing this machine's praises, I'll highlight the improvments they've made:<br /><br />1) You no longer have to remove the water container to fill it up.  It's an awkward shape to try to fill from my refrigerator.  So I just use my frothing pitcher and pour directly into it.  This also chills the pitcher - which is good for the frothing I'll do soon.<br /><br />2) I LOVE the top tray.  I store my espresso cup, tamper (from the old machine - the new one is the only downgrade I've noticed), brew basket, and espresso pitchers on it.  Did I mention I love the tray?  It's a great design perk.<br /><br />3) It still heats up quickly.  A little faster than before for frothing.<br /><br />4) They upgraded the design of the filters.  Smaller holes that all converge into one hole on the bottom.  Note:  Don't put these or the brew basket in the dishwasher - you'll tarnish them.<br /><br />5) The bottom of the brew basket is really cool, the single hole from the filter drips onto a silicone (I'm assuming) cone in the basket which appears to guarantee an even drip between two cups of espresso.  This only matters if you're pulling separate shots.  It may be overdesigned, but I think it's cool.<br /><br />6) There's more clearance under the brew basket!  You couldn't fit a coffee mug under there before (which is why I have the two espresso pitchers).  One (or two) fewer thing to clean!<br /><br />7) The drip tray has two larger holes in the middle.  When your espresso is done (and the machine is off) you can take out the brew basket (it's bad for the valve to keep it there) and set it on the holes to drip and cool off before cleaning.  It's a brilliant improvement.  Also, the drip tray has a spout on it to make it easy to pour out.<br /><br />8) The frothing wand swings!  Very cool.<br /><br />Here are my tips (echoing other reviews).<br />-Read the directions first!  It'll last longer if you do.<br />-Make sure you use the correct roast and ground size and don't overpack.<br />-Play with the brewer until you figure out how long you want to brew (I count to ten).<br />-Ditch the single filter.  You'll never use it.<br />-Get some demitasse cups.<br />-Get a frothing pitcher and use 1% milk.<br />-Ditch the rubber tip on the frothing wand.  It's useless unless you want to easily grow bacteria.<br />-After frothing, blow a little steam out the wand so no milk dries and clogs it.  Wipe the wand with a damp towel shortly after steaming (it's easier to clean when it's hot).<br /><br />That's about it, folks.  You get a lot of bang for your buck with this one.  Even if it only lasted a year, I'd buy another one to replace it and I'd still save money over the more expensive models.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR:  I use it off and on and it's still working well.  The frothing works as well as it did day one.  The espresso function works, but I made the mistake of pregrinding some beans at the grocery store with the ""Espresso"" setting.  The machine struggled to force water through even with minimal packing (Next time I'll try the next largest size).  It also seems like the seal isn't as tight as a year ago.  That said, it still pulls a decent shot.  For the money, I'm still pleased.",5,2009-01-08,298.0,,,Mr. Coffee really did their homework on this one,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

6030,1,"I've had this machine for over a year. I have tried other machines, even a pump. It makes good cappuccinos/lattes when the milk is steamed properly at the right temperature. If your only into espresso shots, I would go with a different pump driven machine.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Inexpensive, Small<br />-Frother is strong, plastic tip is removable<br />-Quiet (then a pump machine)<br />-Latte art hearts (SEE picture)<br /><br />CONS<br />-Supplied tamper is just a slightly flattened end of the coffee scooper.<br />-No frothing pitcher.<br />-Multiple shots requires de-pressuring the machine.<br /><br />NOTES<br />There seems to be a lot of reviews stating it works fine in the beginning then after a while is poor or just stops. Ive noticed that during regular use, water starts to build up in the tank. This is because you never really use all the water in the tank per brew. This excess water I believe causes a problem. Either dump it out after, or what I do is, brew it out ""before"" I make a cappuccino as to warm up the machine on a cold start.<br /><br />There also seems to be a lot of reviews saying it's not real espresso or there is no crema. This is true. It's a steam driven machine they've been making this type of machine for years. It can not match the pressure or the amount of crema produced by a pump driven machine. BUT it can produce a decent 'steam' espresso w/ crema ready to be made to a latte/cappuccino. The problem with the reviewers is that there are so many factors involved in why are not producing crema or a good cup. It could be the bean, the grind, the tamp, perhaps it's a cold start, not enough water, or too much water, etc etc the list goes on. It's something you'll have to figure out yourself.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the bean grind/freshness is directly proportional to the effectiveness of the steamer wand. If the beans are old and/or too course the water will brew through the coffee so fast that no pressure built up for the steamer wand to be effective. Likewise if the beans are too fine or the tamp too hard, the water will have a hard time passing thru the coffee and too much pressure will build up which isnt good either for this machine.<br /><br />Do the descaling with vinegar per instructions.<br /><br />Also want to note I added a picture of a latte heart I made, just to prove minimal latte art is somewhat possible with this machine.",5,2009-01-04,1017.0,,,RECESSION SPECIAL!,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
6031,1,"I'm a coffee fiend. I've used all manner of espresso machines from the cheapest to the most expensive, fully manual to completely automatic. I was interested in reviewing this Mr. Coffee machine, because I'm always keen on manual machines and was curious whether this sub-one-hundred-dollar machine could pull a decent shot. The answer is: yes, but with reservations.<br /><br />First off, the machine comes boxed in eco-friendly packaging. I'm a huge champion of that. It includes everything you need to pull your first shot except ground beans and water. The way you manipulate the machine lets you actually &#34;pull&#34; your shot, determining exactly how much espresso you serve. In addition, you tamp your own grounds. This is where it gets tricky. I found that in order to really get a drinkable shot, you have to tamp...hard! The machine isn't forgiving and you can end up with a soupy mess if you don't press down with gusto.<br /><br />This is where my reservations come in: A cheaper espresso machine like this one has to cut corners somewhere, and Mr. Coffee did it in the build quality. It's not that well made. Given the force required to tamp and the fact that the portafiler (the handle with the filter basket) doesn't smoothly lock into place, I can tell this machine has a limited life span. That said, if you want to try your hand at home-made espresso and aren't sure you want to pull the trigger on something much more expensive, this Mr. Coffee can give you a taste without breaking the bank!",4,2017-12-15,11.0,,,Can pull a good shot with a solid tamp and some practice!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Café Steam",

So, my opinion is a comparison between what I had and this one.  If I had had this one first, I would have probably thought THIS is the best machine on the market (at this price).  I admire the manufacturer's effort, though.<br />PROs: it is automatic (you choose the single or double espresso, you choose small or large latte, etc.)<br />It froths milk<br />It warms up fairly fast (2-3 minutes)<br />It has a support for small espresso cups<br />The milk container can be easily washed after use (which I strongly recommend you do to avoid bad gone milk smell)<br />It is sleek and (after only a month) resistant<br />It is easy to operate<br />It shuts off automatically if not used for 5 min or so (yay!)<br /><br />Cons: TASTE<br />After 4-5 espresso, I could get rid the taste of new machine<br />The Coffee /Espresso does not taste as rich; maybe a bit too bitter (I changed 2-3 brands); In fact, I don't like the taste of it, now I realize that I just hoped that it will change; after a month, I think this is what I will get. Period.<br />The crema is not so rich<br />My Latte Frother is making Capuccino froth (which I don't mind; I don't like lattes w/o foam)  -- buttons are probably inversed, capuccino with latte<br />I have to remove the milk container right after (Or I will forgt to do it) and either wash it or put it in the fridge to save the rest of the milk. And wash the frother mechanism (otherwise it stinks later). It is an unpleasant chore because (no, I am not spoiled) all I want to do is sit and enjoy my coffee.<br />I am now thinking if the coffee holder (the one you put your scoop of coffee in) is made of a too cheap material and it is therefore the chief responsible for the lack of Great Espresso Taste. I am not an engineer or physicist, but it could be. (D'Longhi one's was made of sturdy material).<br /><br />I pondered if to send it back, and was close to do it and invest again in a D'Longhi ($200), but I did not.

6067,1,"I'm on the fence about this machine. I've actually bought it more than once. The first time I picked it up at a Target and it worked well. My wife used it pretty much ever day and it lasted FIVE YEARS. That machine probably produced over 1,500 cappuccinos. So when it finally gave up the ghost, I figured it was a solid investment and it would be money well spent to buy another one just like it. But less than 5 months later, the machine can't make a decent foam and half the water it uses ends up leaking all over the counter. Reading some of the other reviews (for this and for other Mr. Coffee products), it seems as though the quality of their products has taken a serious dive since being acquired by another company. Having said that, if you decide to buy it (it is VERY inexpensive, especially if you get it on sale), know that if you get a good one, it will work quite well--but there is an above-average chance that you'll get a lemon. I believe the issue to be that the water line that feeds the steam wand will come loose (or split) and you'll get uneven foam (very bubbly and not smooth and silky), and the water will drain out the bottom of the machine base.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />It's cheap.<br />The coffee it makes is pretty good.<br />If you get a good one, it will last a pretty good amount of time and you'll get your money's worth.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />It's cheap.<br />The finish is mostly cheap plastic and you're not going to impress anyone that sees it on your kitchen counter.<br />If you get a bad one, there's a good chance it will leak all over the place and it's definitely not worth the money.<br /><br />Overall, if you're serious about your coffee, then you shouldn't waste your time with this.

Their system is antiquated and incomplete.<br /><br />The double espresso holder thing ended up in my disposal - when I went to look for the replacement part on line you could find the single but not the double.  Eesh  - called them (half an hour on hold just to get through)  but they were so so nice and sent me a replacement for free.  Inconvenient but nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately then we lost the small plastic tube which fits inside the milk reservoir and sucks the milk up into the frothing apparatus.<br /><br />This became a major issue.  I attempted to order what I thought was the right piece from their website....there was no picture but it seemed right.....it wasn't...it came and was wrong (it was the little silver tube that fits over the frothing tube).  So I went back on the website - no other tubes to be found  - called them - apparently you can't order this piece by itself (ridiculous as this is the piece that is most likely to get lost or damaged) - you have to order the entire milk unit - OMG- really!  They very nicely said they would send me a new one for free but two weeks later and it's still not here - I've now been going to Starbucks for my lattes for the last month due to  a non-functioning machine.  I called them yesterday - 45 minutes on hold to just talk to a human being and  about twenty minutes more trying to figure it out - a call back from a supervisor who still did not know what was going on.

Even if it breaks down in the first six months it has paid for itself in the first two… (Hence the warranty makes it even a sweeter deal).

Used multiple times daily, it has performed flawlessly! I have used a range of coffees and grinds, (espresso's , French roasts etc), and with use have learned its capabilities, (probably could have read about it in the manual). The best feature of this machine is the frothing attachment. It is a real convenience and time saver. After use, there is a purge feature which thoroughly cleans the milk from all of the &#34;frother's&#34; passageways. If there is still milk in the &#34;frother&#34; the entire attachment can go directly into the fridge until its next use. In addition to metering a perfect 1 or 2 shot espresso, cappuccino or latte', it also permits automatically brewing a 6 oz. cup of coffee simply by holding the espresso button a couple seconds. It also allows for adding additional froth by holding the cappuccino button a couple seconds, when it has frothed enough a tap on the button shuts off the &#34;frother&#34;. The purge cleaning function is accomplished by holding the latte' button a couple seconds. By eliminating the need to wash the frothing wand, the froth pitcher, the spilt milk etc., it makes having a cappuccino practical even if one doesn't have much time. The motor continues to run strong without any noticeable increase in noise level. I had planned to purchase a new brew cup for my $300 Briel , but have come to the conclusion that I won't use the Briel as long as the Mr. Coffee is working well, (which I believe may be a long time).

I roast my own coffee beans so while I am not an expert on espresso I do take my coffee drinking seriously.  I likely will never use the frothing feature but that doesn't make this machine any less of a bargain.

6254,1,"I love steam espresso. It's the only way I've liked coffee for over 15 years. My first steam espresso maker back in the '90s was made by Mr. Coffee, and it was wonderful. Since then, I've owned a Melitta and two Krups. The Krups were by far the best, but apparently Krups has stopped making steam espresso machines. The page on their website is now blank.<br /><br />Anyway, all my previous steam espresso machines were pretty much the same, except for a few quality issues. This new one looks about like all the others. But don't be fooled. This is pure junk. Having used it for a week, I'm going to have to admit I wasted my money and buy a different brand. I suggest if you want a steam espresso machine, look elsewhere.<br /><br />This thing makes strong espresso one time, and weak watery espresso the next time. One time, it has plenty of steam pressure for frothing, the next time, no steam whatsoever. Sometimes it spits coffee all over the counter. Sometimes it starts filling the carafe with cold water even before it has started to heat. It feels like flimsy junk. The frothing wand isn't long enough for anything but a very small pitcher. The plastic top doesn't really fit the carafe and falls off if you're not careful.<br /><br />Take my advice. Buy a different machine. This one is pure junk.<br /><br />FOLLOWUP AFTER A FEW MONTHS:<br />This unit didn't cut it. It's sitting out of the way gathering dust. I miss my Krups. I've gone to making espresso with a pump machine.

As i said...it did work great, but quickly dwindled.<br /><br />As with my other regular espresso machine, I cleaned, washed the decanter, etc. after each use. Used distilled water, and cleaned with vinegar after the appropriate amount of cups were made. Yet three months into it it started failing.<br />First the milk canister did not want to froth, instead I received sputtering, as if it were clogged, tried whole, 2% and nonfat- same results. I chalked this up to the milk, so I used the steam cleaning method to ""wash-out"" the system. Re-tried, yet nothing changed. I then started stemming before each use, for it to give me a sub-par milk froth.<br /><br />After 3 weeks of working with it, the espresso itself started not working. I would choose single or double shot, for it to only half way through excrete a small amount of coffee, leaving me with a un-made shot of espresso. I even wasted making four shots of espresso to amount to a one double-shot.<br /><br />This product worked for the minuscule amount of time I have had it. Now after the espresso part failed, the milk frothing is completely obsolete. Yes, it worked great, yet only for half the time of ownership. Now I am going through the process of returning the unit to Mr.Coffee, since it is out of return time for Amazon. Mr. Coffee is replacing mine, hopefully it last longer than before.<br /><br />****Update:<br />Mr. Cofee without hesitation sent me another replacement, as with the first it worked great every morning, until 3 months later it simply decided to not froth, then the shots became less and less, until the sweet coffee of love did not even come out. Literally....not one drop of sweet nectar of love.<br /><br />I wanted to love this machine...but sadly it does not even stand up to my original espresso machine, ironically , my 4 year old... 50 dollar steam espresso machine-works and froths with the frothing wand without problem- and I love seeing it every morning.<br /><br />I uploaded a video, of the second machine with the loud struggling noise.

It will produce five excellent coffees a day for two+ years, then die. Used or refurbished will die fast (like three months in one case).<br /><br />Pretty much everything is right about this; it just works great. In particular it does NOT run super-heated steam through coffee like the delonghi we bought recently as a try, which we're now selling on craigslist. (Horribly bitter coffee results.)<br /><br />Figure you're renting the thing for $40 a year.<br /><br />Update March 27, 2015. Just died. Flashing lights only. The repair process described on the web is FAR too involved.<br /><br />So two years of daily multi-cup service and good-quality coffee for $75. (My previous cheap Delonghi started breaking within nine months and was dead in 18.)<br /><br />Now maybe a machine that costs five or ten times as much would last longer. But really: five or ten times as long? I'm ordering another one of these.<br /><br />Update Nov. 2 2013: Now at seven months and going strong, so it's already outlasted the Delonghi.<br /><br />Just replaced my Delonghi Bar 32 which worked pretty well but disintegrated over 18 months.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R20S4H2K6MG0UR/ref=cm_srch_res_rtr_alt_4<br /><br />Much prefer how this one works. Heats up much faster -- less than a minute, and only about 15 seconds to get steam up to heat after making coffee.<br /><br />With the Delonghi if I let the steam light turn on (so the heating element went off), it would run out of steam power before finishing the steaming. So I had to let the steam heat up to *just before* it got to &#34;ready,&#34; so the element would stay on and maintain steam pressure. Annoying management in the early hours of the morning...<br /><br />The steamer is much more effective with plenty of steam power, makes very rich, stiff foam even with whole milk.<br /><br />In general this machine is much &#34;smarter&#34; than the Delonghi. Won't explain boring niggling details but it manages things for you more.<br /><br />And I don't have to refill the water reservoir nearly as often as with the Delonghi.<br /><br />And it's $72 instead of $120.<br /><br />I've had it less than a month, so we'll see how long it lasts.",4,2013-02-13,4.0,True,,"Works very well, lasted two years of daily multi-cup use. $75.

The expresso must come out light brown and foamy most of the time.  It just takes experimenting.  For the price, it makes a delicious mocha or Chino.  I imagine the bad reviews are people like me when I made mistakes and didn't clean it properly when the frother clogged, and when it didn't shoot out expresso perfect when I did it wrong....keep trying.

6279,1,"Overall, I have had a positive experience with the Cafe Barista as a simple, no-nonsense espresso machine.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- You still do have to grind beans and tamp the coffee yourself. This is a lot of work. For approximately double the cost, you can have a super-automatic espresso maker that will do this for you. Something to keep in mind.<br /><br />- A big part of the front section of this machine is dedicated to, perhaps even crowded by, a milk frother. This is a total waste for me, since I like to drink my espresso (brewed as a 'long shot', i.e. more dilute) as coffee with just a touch of creamer instead of ruining it by dumping it into scalding hot milk. In other words, I am not a big fan of lattes and cappuccinos, so this focus on the milk frother seems silly to me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Makes a nice espresso. This might sound simple, but there is actually a lot that goes into this (perfect temperature, pressure, timing) and this machine seems to get it right.<br /><br />- Nice size water reservoir. I personally don't like removing it and filling it at the tap (because it gets heavy!). Instead, I use a wine decanter to fill it.<br /><br />- Straightforward buttons on the front panel<br /><br />- All that coffee grind tamping is a really great arm workout!<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for a semi-automatic espresso maker, then this is a great option.",4,2013-04-15,3.0,,,Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista Espresso Maker,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

I love this Mr. Coffee.  An ordinary coffeemaker can't do a single cup well.  I read somewhere that as a matter of physics, it takes time for the grounds to absorb hot water and then leach out the tasty oils needed for a good brew. Single-cup drip pots yield a flat yucky brew even if you put extra grounds in.  I had found that with one of those silver stovetop expressomakers I got a nice, layered single cup of coffee, I suppose because of the forcing of steam through the grounds.  With this nice Mr Coffee expressomaker we get to use our favorite coffee which it took us forever to find.  I haven't tried to do cappuccino or latte.  Don't care if I ever do.

6287,1,"I got this thing right around the holidays thinking that it would make a nice treat for guests and family, and because I secretly want to be a Barista. It was at first a disappointment. It took me about 2 months before I figured it out and got it making good shots. The first pot of &#34;espresso&#34; I got out of it by just letting it run tasted like it came out of the back side of a horse. But it was on par with the coffee I had been drinking out of an auto drip machine all my life. There were many reasons for this, mostly because of my own fault but the machine itself has a lot of quirks that must be accounted for before you get a good cup out of it. But I will say, with practice it is possible to get a good cup out of it.  Rather than going through the good and bad things about the machine I'm gonna tall you how I was able to get a good shot out of it and general tips to make it work for you.<br /><br />General Tips:<br />1. Get a good grinder. A burr grinder is a must. The hand grinders are good and cheap but take a lot of work. A decent auto one can be had for under 60. If you try to do it with anything less the brew will be pretty terrible. Use a pretty fine grind, but not as fine as &#34;true espresso&#34;.<br />2. Use whole beans, dark roast, and grind them yourself. Pre-ground coffee doesn't do well in this thing, and its often too coarse. ALthough they do sell some preground &#34;espresso beans&#34; that have the right grind and may work okay.<br />3. Fill the tank up almost to the top with water before brewing.<br />4. Buy a decent tamper. The one that comes with it wont work.<br />5. If you fill the portafilter (the basket) to the very top with grounds, its good for about 1-2 shots and no more. Not the 4 that it advertises. If you fill it to the top and tamp it down its just about right for a single cup.<br />6. The steaming wand is funny. Once it is up to pressure it puts out a good amount of steam. The bad is that its short as heck and it doesn't move. Use it with a 12-ounce pitcher and tilt the whole machine to get the angle right. It takes a lot of work to get it right and its like you need 3 hands but its possible. Also the froth assister only works if you line the intake hole right up against the surface of the milk, otherwise throw it away and learn to steam without it. Also the steaming wand MUST be cleaned after every use with soap and water, otherwise the milk will collect on it and stay there and make you sick.<br />7. I don't think I've been able to use this thing without making at least a small mess in some way. Clean after every use.<br />8. Start with making Americanos which are diluted 1:1 with water. They are very forgiving. Once you nail that, then try venturing to making a good espresso shot by itself and other milk based drinks.<br /><br />Brew Method:<br />1. Fill the water tank.<br />2. Clean out and dry the filter basket and head.<br />3. Dry the basket and fill with grounds to the top, then tamp (fairly hard, this helps build up pressure when brewing). This is good for 1 shot. For 2 shots fill the basket again on top of the first tamp and tamp again. (Although if you don't tamp at all you can get decent americano like coffee)<br />4. Put the head, without the basket with the grounds on the machine. Turn the machine to steam and wait for it to build up pressure.<br />5. Once steam is coming out a full pressure (still without the grounds or basket in yet) put an empty cup under the spout and turn it to brew. This flushes out the water spout of old grounds, heats the head and the cup, and helps get the pressure up.<br />6. Once a bit of water starts coming out  turn the machine to the off position. Dump the water that came out and replace the cup, take off the head and put the basket with the grounds in it. Put it back on the machine and lock it in.<br />7. Turn the dial to brew again. And begin the brew.<br />8. Stop it after about 2-3 ounces for a single shot, or about 5 ounces for a double shot. Remove the cup immediately. The drops that continue to drip taste terrible. Either let it collect in the drip tray or put another cup to catch it and throw it out.<br />9. Add water for an americano, or steamed milk for a latte or cappuccino. Or drink it straight if you're hardcore.<br /><br />Steaming Milk with the Steam Wand:<br />1. Add cold milk to a cup or steaming pitcher. You only need about 3-6 ounces. Make sure its a pretty shallow container. The wand's not very long.<br />2. Turn the dial to steam to let it build up pressure. Stop it after its at pressure.<br />3. (Froth assister) Immerse the the milk so the surface is right at the intake hole on the black plastic piece. Turn the steam on and let it froth keeping the hole right at the surface, until the milk is just about too hot to touch. Turn the steam off.<br />3. (No froth assister) If you're not using the froth assister then put the tip just below the surface and tilt the machine about 30 degrees. You are aiming for a smooth churring. If it sounds like a snake hiss you're too deep (can burn the milk) and if it sounds like blowing bubbles through a straw you're too shallow (losing texture). After you get enough air into it (about 10 seconds) sink the tip deeper and let it whirlpool. If it screeches, you need to bring it back up and get more air into it. Keep the angle the whole time. Once its just too hot to touch turn of the steam.<br />4. Stamp the container on the counter a few times to get rid of the big bubbles, and swirl it for a bit to polish the texture and infuse the foam.<br />5. Pour it into your drink.  Use a spoon to hold back the foam, and scoop it on top for a cappuccino. If you want latte art, its possible but you'll have to learn on your own.<br /><br />Overall: Comparing this to other espresso machines that cost 10 times or a 100 times more, this machine is pretty terrible. But as a way to learn how to make a good shot this machine is perfect. If you can get a good shot out of this thing, you can get a good shot out of almost anything.

I discovered that the coffee was being brewed one cup at a time, and with pump espresso machines, although not quite at espresso strength, as per my wishes.<br />So, returning to the states, I knew what I had to do----but then, which machine?<br />Nope, can't drop $400+, so started doing my research in cyber-land.  Long story short, this machine is the only 15 bar pump available for under $100, and 2 years ago it was about $70 on Amazon.<br />I have one of these, ditto my brother, we both drink a fair amount of coffee, and we are both equally happy with our machines.

6302,1,"I love my espresso maker, it makes great espresso.  The only downside to this product is the built in milk frother is useless as a frother, but that's not its fault.  Frothing milk properly for a latte or cappuccino requires more than just blowing a little compressed hot air into the milk.  The good news is that the frother setting isn't useless, it makes an important pressure release valve so you can safely turn it off and unscrew the lid after you've unplugged it and used the frother to expel all the excess pressure, avoiding steam burns.<br /><br />Over all, I gave this espresso maker a 5 because for its price, it's hard to find a comparable espresso maker.  It makes good espresso, and that's all it does.  The fact that it only makes espresso is actually a plus in my book, complicated latte and cappuccino makers with internal milk bags and creamer are a huge pain to clean and always get clogged.

6310,1,"Having been raised on South Indian filter coffee, I always have coffee with milk, and prefer it 'strong'. Coffee from standard coffee makers (with cream) is just too light and bland for my liking. Even cappuccino at most coffee shops tastes like lightly flavored milk foam. I usually make do with Nescafe Instant in hot milk, but I wanted a little variety. That's when I decided to get this. Keep in mind that this is my first Espresso maker, so many of my pros and cons might apply to Espresso makers in general and not just this unit.<br /><br />This is my modus operandi:<br />1. Empty water reservoir. Fill with fresh water (since I usually make only a cup a day; more on weekends)<br />2. Dig out coffee from filter pod using a fork, wash, fill with fresh ground coffee (2-3 mins)<br />2. Turn on coffee maker. Wait for green light (1 min)<br />3. Poke the steam nozzle with a safety pin to ensure its not clogged<br />4. Fill half of coffee mug with milk. Steam using coffee maker till frothing (2-3 mins)<br />5. Add sugar<br />6. Place mug on coffee maker tray, switch to espresso, turn off when mug nearly full and remove mug quickly (1 min)<br />7. Run some steam into a cup with water and clean the steam nozzle with a paper towel (1-2 mins)<br /><br />Totally takes about 10-12 mins. Nescafe instant coffee (just microwave milk, mix in instant coffee and sugar) takes just 2-3 mins total.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. It works<br />2. I can adjust the proportion of milk and espresso to get just the right strength and taste; coffee from standard coffee makers is too light no matter what I do<br />3. I'm experimenting with various types of coffee; can't do that with instant<br />4. Cheap (comparing with other pressure-based Espresso makers)<br />5. Steam maker great for frothing milk<br />6. Coffee mug platform has a decent-sized reservoir for overflow<br />7. Large water reservoir when making several cups a day<br />8. Option to fill 2 cups at once - I don't do this often since that makes each cup too dilute for my liking<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Very noisy! I can't use it early in the morning when we have guests over for fear of waking them up (our guest bedroom is close to our kitchen).<br />2. Steam nozzle had dried up the second time I used it and nothing came out, and after a minute I heard a loud pop and had steam coming out the top of the unit! Pricking the nozzle with a safety pin fixed this; I do this before each use now.<br />3. Even the larger filter pod doesn't give a strong/large enough shot of espresso - this is just based on my personal preference. I've reduced the volume of milk to compensate, but that gives a smaller cup of coffee than I'd like ideally.<br />4. Too little clearance between the espresso spouts and the coffee tray for most coffee cups.<br />5. The whole thing just takes a tad too long for my liking, with too many things to be done, for such a small cup of coffee in the end. I'm still resorting to instant more than half the time.<br /><br />To summarize, if you're sure about getting an Espresso maker, getting this one is an easy choice - it works well and comes cheap. If you're not sure what it takes to use an Espresso maker, consider the time and effort you need to spend to get a relatively small cup of coffee, before you take the plunge.",4,2009-11-06,2.0,True,,"Works great, painful to clean","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

6343,1,"I have been using modestly priced espresso makes for 20 years and, so, have had quite a few machines.  This one makes very good espresso drinks. I use Starbucks coffee and it is one machine where you can tell what kind of coffee you're using.  This is good.  Since I mostly make lattes, the ease of using the milk container is important to me. I am used to having to hold a container while the nozzle steams the milk.  Not with this machine.  You pour the milk in a milk container, affix the container on to the machine, aim the nozzle into the cup and push the button.  No holding the cup.  After the steamed milk goes into the cup, the espresso is automatically added.  Neat.  Unfortunately, you won't get a full portion of steamed milk unless you have almost completely filled the milk container because the suction apparatus doesn't work if the milk level is less than (almost) an inch.  So, after you make your drink, you have left-over milk in the container to store or throw away.  Also, it's more time consuming to clean that milk container than it is to wipe a nozzle.  After a month's worth of use, I find myself using Q-tips to get the milk gunk out of the interior of the steaming tub.  I find this annoying, but can live with it.  It is really nice not to have to stand there and hold a container while the steamed milk is prepared.<br /><br />I read a number of the reviews before I purchased this machine.

Older people (like me) will have this problem. The seal between the cup holding the coffee grounds and the machine is very poor. Before the coffee is completely brewed steam is pouring out and I mean pouring, from this seal and also the reservoir seal. Be careful you don't get burned.

Then we tried it again and it worked fine so it must have been user error right?. At least that what we thought. It wasn't! The machine is rather easy to use... not too noisy and seems to make a great espresso when it's working. Other than that...be prepared to have it work 1 in 3 to 4 times you use it! It became rather annoying and I got to the point that I was tired of wasting espresso and throwing so much of it in the trash.

My husband drinks a double shot every morning, and then the machine rests until next morning. We have noticed, as other reviews have said, that if you are making two espressos in a row, the second one isn't as good. I've never tried the steamed milk part, but I get plenty of crema on the espresso.  You have to figure out the best grind and how hard to tamp the grinds.  Making espresso is not an exact science, and that is the fun of it! I use a spice bottle for tamping, which works perfectly.  I cannot see spending more money for a machine when this one meets our needs so well.<br /><br />UPDATE - Here is how you make the best espresso with this newer model of the ECM160 espresso machine.  First, have your beans ground to Turkish grind, the finest grind on commercial grinders.  Or just grind your own beans super fine.  For one shot, loosely fill the basket about 3/4 full.  Tamp very gently to about 1/2 full.  Do all your prep, turn machine on. The espresso will come out fairly steadily, and you'll think its done.  Wait.  Some crema will bubble out.  Wait some more.  Finally a solid stream of crema emerges.  Leave the machine on for awhile until you are sure all moisture is out of the machine.  Otherwise, it ends up in your next expresso, making the coffee watery.  It took me awhile to figure all this out, but the espresso is excellent with about 1/2 of it crema.<br /><br />If this sounds complicated, it really isn't.  I just wanted to be very specific in my explanation.",4,2013-04-27,2.0,True,,update to great for single espresso,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

The shortness of the frothing wand makes for a somewhat awkward frothing process. because of the shortness, you need to use a decent amount of milk for the wand to reach below the surface of the milk. Also, the portafilter requires a good amount of torque to get it to the lock position, although I know its a safety function to prevent steam from escaping while brewing. Other users have said that it loosens a little with use, so we'll see. You need to be sure that you use a cup/mug that is pretty short (3&#34; or so). A standard size mug wont fit. And you have to manually stop the brewing process (turn knob from brew to stop) which is actually not a bad thing if you want to be able to adjust the strength. I spoon the grounds into the 14g filter and level it off before tamping. That gives a pretty consistent amount of grounds. The included scoop/tamp is nice but I'll probably purchase a stainless/heavy duty tamp because the plastic one included is just kind of cheap and I can't use the grip that I'd like to use because the spoon is in the way. Whew, all that said, I'm happy with the purchase and this will serve as a nice treat for weekend mornings.<br />*UPDATE You can remove the black rubber steam wand cover! Now the steam tube works great because I can clearly see and adjust the tip of the tube. Makes a great espresso shot and steams milk wonderfully.

6557,1,"I was married to my second wife for almost twenty years. I've had my car for about twenty one years now. But my longest relationship in this life was with my Cappucino Machine - over twenty five years. So you can appreciate that I was upset when my Riviera finally broke for good.<br /><br />Actually that's not completely true. I could possibly have gotten it fixed yet again. But the machine is out of production. Some parts are still available but not all. One of the parts no longer available is one of the seals. The result of that missing seal has been that for about a year now when I try to make my daily cappucino it would spray boiling water in my face.<br /><br />Not a good feature.<br /><br />I would drape a paper towel over it so as to intercept the spray. It leaked elsewhere too. It still looked cool of course. Solid crome over solid brass with a pressure dial and an eagle on top. The last time I saw one on sale they were well over a thousand dollars. But in fact it was the maintenance that cost a lot not just the initial purchase price. I had sent it into the shop every two years for new seals. Each trip was about $150.<br /><br />So a week or so ago when it wouldn't turn on - probably a switch again - I called it quits. I resolved to get a new machine. I expected to spend about $800 (the cost of a new Pavoni). To my delight it looked as though I could get a ""starter"" automatic machine for only about $400. But as it happens my twenty year old car needed a new transmission and that cost $4,000. So I decided to get some sort of interim machine for now until my finances recovered.<br /><br />I knew as soon as I openned the box that I wouldn't send it back. That was because I immediately dropped the glass carafe on the kitchen floor, shattering it into a million shards. The other problem was that the directions require you to measure the water in that carafe. So I had to improvise my brewing procedure. Fortunately this is a truly simple machine. I have devised a procedure that makes a wonderful cappucino. I am no longer in the market for a more expensive machine. Like the song says ""Ich habe genug"".<br /><br />Considering what I have been accustomed to spending on my morning coffee, this machine is really cheap. I could just throw it away every year and buy a new one and still come out ahead. It is almost a disposable cappucino maker. My former machine, the Riviera, was all metal. This machine is all plastic. You could sneak it through a metal detector. It is very lightly built. But I think nevertheless that it will last. My sold brass Riviera had a big boiler that took a while to come up to temperature. I would turn it on first thing in the morning and leave it on all day. That meant that the rubber seals inside cooked all day. That's why I had to have them replaced nearly every year. This little machine has a little boiler that heats up fast. I fill it with water and turn it on. Then I quickly find a cup, get out the milk, grind the beans and tamp. These actions take about five minutes at which time the coffee starts coming out. When there's enough (but not too much) I switch it to steam and froth the milk. Then - and this is the important point - I turn it off.<br /><br />It takes me about six minutes to make a cappucino. The Mr. Coffee is only on for those six minutes.<br /><br />It makes a great cup of Joe. It has only one flaw. Chicks are not impressed with it the way they always were with my gleaming chrome Riviera.",5,2011-09-08,5.0,True,,No longer in the market,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

I assume it flaps up to hold the steel filter in the handle?? But I’m not sure... If you twist the filter once it’s in place it will stay, so that flap just gets in the way.<br /><br />All in all it’s a great little machine.

6606,1,"My wife likes her coffee dark and strong.  And when I say ""dark and strong,"" I mean that she finds the darkest roast she can - the closer to pitting soil the better - and then uses 7 scoops (not the normal 5) for a 10-cup pot.<br /><br />Even at these settings, though, sometimes her coffee just wasn't strong enough for her.  It was really only that first cup that did it for her.  Teh rest of the pot was just a tad weak.  We tried going to 8 scoops, but that was too much for our coffee maker.  It often spilled put of the basket while brewing, getting grounds in her coffee.  I suggested making two pots each morning, but she didn't want to do all that before going to work.  She just wanted to turn the machine on and pour.<br /><br />We tried a Keurig, filling the reusable K-Cup with our own coffee.  That still didn't do the trick.  So, I decided that we needed to try an espresso maker.  Of course, I wasn't going to spend $150 or $300 on an experiment.  So, I got her this one for Christmas.<br /><br />It's been wonderful.  She gets exactly what she needs from her coffee now.<br /><br />I was worried at first.  Some of the reviews mentioned problems with brewing, and it doesn't come with a tamper.  We've had no brewing problems.  As for a tamper, a bottled of Mrs. Dash's seasoning works just fine.<br /><br />The two other issues that kept coming up in reviews were the fact that the wand was immobile and that the machine wouldn't steam.<br /><br />Yes, the wand is stuck in place.  That can be a problem if you're too energetic in your frothing.  If that's an issue for you or your mugs are too big, you probably shouldn't get this machine.  For us, we figured out how to move our pitcher in smaller circles, and it's been just fine.<br /><br />As for not steaming/frothing, I think I figured out the problem that most people complaining about this are having.  This machine holds enough water for 4 ""cups"" of espresso.  If you pour in 4 and make 4 shots of espresso, THERE WON'T BE ANY MORE WATER TO STEAM/FROTH YOUR MILK!  So, you'll need to do one of two things.  First, you can pour in 4 ""cups"" of water while only making 2 shots of espresso.  This has been fine for us.  Second, you could make four shots of espresso, refill the water, and then steam your milk.  This is where the real drawback comes in, though.  You obviously don't want to do this too quickly because you might burn yourself releasing the little bit of leftover steam.  On the other hand, if you wait too long, your espresso is cold.  This is probably what you want to think about most before buying this: ""Do I usually make 4 or more shots of espresso that need steamed/frothed milk?""  If you do, I'd say this machine won't be for you.  However, if you can get by with making 2 or 3 shots, you should enjoy this.<br /><br />And, most of all, if what you want is a very good, very inexpensive espresso maker, this is for you.",4,2011-01-10,3.0,True,,Very Much Worth the Money,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

6632,1,"We bought a Delonghi pump machine about six years ago.  Like this machine, it was made in China and that seems to mean quality/function is hit or miss.  If you get one that works properly it's five stars, but almost as likely it will fail horribly and earn one star.  Thank goodness for warranties, or I would not take another chance on a Chinese made anything.  Fast forward to this past weekend, our old machine needed repairs again and I decided it was time for a new machine.  I shopped all espresso makers from $50 to $200 and was torn between the Gaggia Evolution that I could find factory refurbished for $125, and this machine that I found locally for $79.  Incidentally, right now you can get this direct from the Mr. Coffee site for $49.99, and if you sign up for e-letters get an extra 10% off (also free shipping).  I didn't find that deal until after I bought, though.<br /><br />The initial impression is that they have hit the line between function and cost- that is, nothing feels more than adequate.  The portafilter holder is lightweight, but good enough.  The warming tray is thin metal, but will do the job.  The buttons are small and cheap feeling, but they work.  I guess this is reassuring in a way- I was wondering how they can sell a decent working machine for this price, it's because of low material cost and cheap labor.  If this unit doesn't last more than two years, I think it would be cheaper in the long run to buy a more substantial machine- time will tell.  What I like about the new machine compared to our old (and many others): there is a generous amount of room between the bottom of the portafilter and the tray, I can fit a small mug under there.  There is a good amount of space under the frothing arm, also the arm has a good range of swivel.  The water reservoir is fairly generous.  It heats up quickly.  It's ready to steam quickly.  It's easy to clean.<br />What I don't like: the portafilter is double layer metal and sealed- no way to open it up to clean residue.  Portafilter holder feels like you need to be careful how you handle it or it will break.  Coffee temperature not very hot.  Electrical cord is very short.<br /><br />I have only used this twice, so I'm still learning the machine:  this machine seems to have more going on automatically inside, amazing and wonderful to behold, if it doesn't quit.  I mean things like you cannot use a function until the machine says it's ready, it does an automatic pre-infusion, after steaming it performs a cool down operation with shots of water that expel into the drip tray, it makes seemingly random sounds at inappropriate times . . . our old unit was very basic compared to this.  The coffee it makes- well, I made a throwaway espresso last night just to see it operate (I'm still smelling oil and plastic, so I didn't feel like drinking one yet), and just finished the first cappuccino;  this drink is not up to what I was making in the old machine in three areas- espresso is not as rich, not as hot, and milk did not froth as well.  I attribute two of those to lack of experience; I need to dial in the grind of the coffee and perhaps ditch the rubber frothing cover.  I had allowed the machine to preheat about ten minutes, and ran water through everything to warm it- maybe that isn't long enough, but as a practical matter that's all the time I'm likely to give it.<br />Bottom line- right now I think this may be a very good machine for (relatively speaking) a small amount of money.  I'll add a follow up once I've had more time with it.<br /><br />I found this review on CoffeeGeek.com that has some good information if you want to get into the nuts and bolts of it: http://coffeegeek.com/reviews/consumer/mrcoffeeespresso/Tonu/6038<br /><br />1/06/15:  I adjusted the grind on the coffee to be finer, and used a fairly light tamp pressure.  I took the frothing tube cover off.  The expresso was dark and rich, the milk had a chance to heat before it foamed, all together a much better drink than my first try- I think I'll be happy with this if the machine doesn't fail. Tomorrow the wife gets back and I begin making two drinks at a time, we'll see how that goes.<br /><br />1/13/15: Still playing with the grind, I backed off the fineness and that is working well, but we need to get a darker roast bean.  Milk is frothing well now with practice (hold the tip at the surface to let air get sucked into the milk and create foam, then drop the tip down to heat the liquid).  I've ordered another filter basket, it is so much easier to have a second one filled and ready, swap it out with the first one that is full of soupy grounds.

6633,1,"I owned this product for a long time. first the espresso quality is high and is comparable or better than more expensive machines. The machine has design problems though:<br /><br />The rubber bushing seal between the plastic water tank and the base unit erodes and water leaks heavily for some time when the tank is filled, in both cases when tank is removed, filled and replaced OR when water is filled with the tank in place. <br /><br />The second problem is that there is an inner plastic tube that carries water to the top of unit for delivery to the pump. The plastic tube becomes loose after some usage and water leaks from there as well. I was able to check this out being an engineer. <br /><br />Not a manufacturing problem but the selector knob on the right is flimsy and does not turn as easily.<br /><br />The coffee basket is very tight and can only be closed to a bit left of center point. I tried with various fill levels and coarseness of coffee grounds. Even with partially closed, however, coffee comes out good.<br /><br />After brewing is done, we find that there is water in the coffee basket and spent grinds fall into the coffee cup below.<br /><br />Machine can accommodate medium size cups. Taller cups cannot be used.<br /><br /> I wished water can be hotter as the brew is not hot enough.<br /><br />In spite of the above, I still find this machine does fantastic job in brewing in comparison.

6638,1,"Bottom line I bought this to save money from going to Dunkin or Starbucks. I have to admit with the right brewing time and the right type of beans the coffee is right on par with the aforementioned coffee stores. If you treat this machine as your regular type of coffee maker or a kruieg for that matter your not going to get the best results. This espresso maker actually takes some technique to get down in just a couple of brews. I'm used to the stove top expresso makers which in my opinion has a slight edge on this machine but I like this machine because it prepares my latte quicker and I don't have to warm up my milk in the microwave or in a pot on the stove. I must admit my first cup of latte was terrible!! But I know right off the back the expresso was water downed. So instead of using a coffee mug that I normally use for my stove top expresso I used my expresso shot glass so I knew when to stop brewing. I should mention that with this machine there is no timed brewing you do it manually your self, thats why I use the expresso shot glass to get a consistent measurement every time. I would recommend getting a stainless steel frothing pitcher for the milk and a thermometer to warm up the milk up to 155 F. As for the coffee brand I use Pilon or Cafe Bustelo which I have drank since the 4th grade.",5,2016-02-09,,,,If you treat this machine as your regular type of coffee maker or a kruieg for that matter your not going to get the best result,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
6639,1,"I'm a 58 year old retired engineer and understand the limitations of these cheap little machines as this is my 3rd small type but first Mr. Coffee brand. I must say they have improved. Anyway if you follow the directions to a tee your going to get disappointing water logged coffee. But if you have a basic understanding of pressure and steam you'll lean to modify your operation of this little machine. What I do is fill the coffee filter holder to max shot coffee level line because your going to want to stop the excess water rush when the thick black coffee and cream stops pouring and that doesn't leave much coffee IMO but that's OK. I use only purified water unless you want your machine to last only 1 year from mineral deposits, and I fill glass carafe to the top of the metal band past the highest mark to ensure more than enough water and steam to do the job. With everything in place i.e. power off, coffee filter holder full locked in, steam cap screwed down tight, frothing arm extended and ready with cup and milk standing by...  I then turn the machine to knob to steam first to allow the machine to build pressure and steam without prematurely diluting the coffee filter holder, as soon as the frothing arm starts to sputter a hint of water I quickly switch the control knob to brew coffee position which brings in only hot steam and water trickling out only dark thick coffee and this is where you have to be rehearsed to act fast and operate the machine effectively! With the thick black coffee trickling, get your milk cup ready sitting under the frothing arm ready to be lifted up as soon as you see the brewing coffee go from slow tricking thick dark coffee to cream foam. Now GET READY to turn the control knob back to steam the INSTANT you see that the slow dark cream foam trickling out slowly starts to speed up. The moment before you see the slow dark cream foam trickling out start to speed up to water, I Instantly raise my milk cup submersing the frothing arm under the milk to avoid splatter while simultaneously switching the control knob to steam, which instantly stops the brewing process to the coffee filter holder preventing water dilution. Once your milk is frothed to my liking I switch the control knob to off. That's it, perfect Espresso IMO. When not in use to prevent premature compression damage to the sealing gaskets, I only slightly keep both the steam cap and the filter holder screwed in place. If you lock them down to full tight position when not in use, I find that it will prematurely compress the sealing gaskets and they will start to leak early making brewing ineffective.  Having said all of this, as a protective disclaimer I must say that this is what “I DO” and I'm not recommending any of these operating actions to anyone.  You should use the instruction book to a tee for OK strong watery coffee.",5,2016-01-05,,,,FIVE STARS FOR RATIO BETWEEN PRICE AND BREWING QUALITY,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

If you are a newcomer, start with Starbucks espresso blend and experiment.<br />  * Warm the beans in a microwave until they are warm, shiny and fragrant (30 to 60 sec) before grinding.<br />  * Don't remove the rubber tip from the frother arm: it operates on the Venturi principle to mix air bubbles with the steam.<br />  * Yes, a very large mug of appropriate aspect ratio will easily fit under the brew head.<br />  * If you are using a large mug for café au lait, etc., microwave the empty mug for a minute so that it is warm.before using.<br />  * No need to stand and hold the milk receptacle for frothing,  Just place it on a pedestal of appropriate dimensions,  An inverted ash tray fits perfectly for me.<br />  * No reason at all that the frothing receptacle be made of stainless steel, so long as the milk is cold.<br />xxx",5,2016-03-23,2.0,,,Also makes good café au lait in a large mug,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",
6641,1,"I purchased this through another retailer in November and received is Dec. 7, 2017. We absolutely loved it at first. My husband was ridiculously spending $7 on a cup of coffee a day!!! Sometimes that crazy man would go through the coffee shop twice a day!!! Anyway, we opened this the day we got it and immediately primed it and started brewing. I think we brewed 3 different drinks that day. For the next few months, we were making at least 2 drinks/5 days a week and then a few on the weekend. It did great. I loved that it was automatic...push a button and continue getting ready for the day while the coffee brewed. It was amazing. Well fast forward to May/June 2018 and the automatic features have stopped. The frother no longer works unless you specifically turn the frother on. It doesn't work with any of the drinks selected. The drinks run longer than they should so you get water like coffee brewed at the end and you manually have to turn it off. The amount of coffee brewed is not what it should be which means we have to do two fills on the portafilter and run it twice while standing there watching it. I'm so glad I got this on sale for $99 and didn't pay the current price of $199. When I bought it, I had read reviews that it doesn't last but thought I would take a chance.

6642,1,"Love love love this machine! I was very Leary in purchasing this as I'm a coffee snob (worked at a coffee shop) who likes her coffee quite strong. I always had a hand held frother and used my stove top Italian espresso maker for lattes. When my hand held broke and my now 5 month old was born I needed something hands free. This actually was better than I expected. The espresso shots are strong, and the froth is great! Just like any froth low fat milk froths a lot better than any other milk or milk type product. My one recommendation is that you read all the instructions first. Was a great laugh trying to make my first few lattes. Also keep an eye on the water reservoir it will literally run out mid espresso shot and make a loud noise. There is supposed to be a warning but mine doesn't seem to do that. My brother has the same machine and his does not froth the exact amount of milk each time. I don't have an issue with that. Only use espresso unless you like a weak tasting latte. Has an excellent amount of crema and I make at least 1 double hot latte every morning and 4 espresso shots over ice for my husband. The espresso shots are quite strong! I also don't use the clean function but after every latte do a manual froth with just water to clean the tube. Works just like the cleaning button but takes less time. wish I could give this 5 stars but to have 5 stars it needs to be perfect and running out of water mid espresso shot without warning is quite frustrating at times.",4,2017-01-12,,True,,Great machine!

6644,1,"So, I will write this review as what the machine is, not what it is not.  What I mean, its not a $500 - $1000 espresso machine.  Just isn't.  And, I didn't expect that.  I think some reviews believe it should perform on a par with the bigger, fancier machines.<br /><br />I am a latte drinker.  So I don't consider myself a total espresso/coffee aficionado.  With the amount of milk, I can't really taste minor differences in the coffee flavor.  Really bad is really bad, that I can tell.  But, the minor differences noticeable in &#34;neat&#34; coffee probably isn't as noticeable to me.<br /><br />When I first started using the machine, I measured the water temp coming out and followed other reviews advice and did a cleaning on the unit, using a good bit of vinegar.  That did seem to raise the temp a bit.  I also always first run one or two empty espresso pulls to make sure i'm getting hot water.  Both of these seemed to help.<br /><br />So, positives:  Easy to use.  Easy to get froth or froth/steamed milk (Mrs. likes that for hot chocolate).  I like that I can put the milk container in the fridge for another day.  There are two levels for the cup base, and that is convenient.  It holds a fair amount of water, which is helpful.<br /><br />Negative:  You HAVE TO remember to put the metal spout in your coffee cup when make latte/cappuccino.  Yep, made that mess twice.  That's not the machine's fault, but there isn't really a lip around the unit that would contain the milk overflow.... it ran down onto the counter and into a drawer.  This isn't the machine's fault, and I'm not taking a star away, but it would have been a great tweak to the design.  Kinda idiot insurance.<br /><br />I would suggest not removing the water reservoir too often as that could be a leak point.  I haven't, but will be to do a cleaning on it soon.  But, when its reinstalled, I will double check it.<br /><br />So, given it is what it is, and isn't what it isn't.... its a good machine, that makes good lattes and didn't cost an arm and a leg.",5,2018-03-13,,True,,Really bad is really bad,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

6651,1,"Overall, I'd say this is a College student espresso machines.<br /><br />This machine produces coffee that's just a slight smidge over &#34;average&#34;.<br />It does not produce super fancy coffee.<br /><br />Does the machine work? Yes... And no.<br />  The espresso part works pretty well, and it makes... Some pretty good espresso! I personally use Café Bustello. I tried Starbucks at espresso but Starbucks espresso isn't as finely ground as it should be... Therefore it produced pretty weak coffee.. Like coffee pot coffee, not strong espresso. Café Bustello works amazing with this machine and it's pretty cheap.<br />  The milk frother isn't the best, in all honesty. It works pretty okay with producing a thinner froth like a latte but it does terrible with producing a thick cappuccino. (This could be due to the milk I use though.. I'm not sure. I use coconut and soy milk. It might work better with cow's milk. No idea, though.)<br />  It also seems like the frother waters down the milk just a little bit.. I'm not sure why. I've noticed it but it's not so bad that it destroys your beverage.<br />  Luckily I only really use the espresso from this machine to make iced latte, I don't usually froth milk, too.<br /><br />What's the overall quality of this machine?<br />  I'd rate it a 6 on a scale from 1-10 (10 being best quality) it could definitely be a lot better.<br />The area where that holds the little (bed?) for your espresso grounds is stained with coffee.. It doesn't look pretty. This happened about a month after using is at least once a day. I'm not sure if they make replacements or not. If they do, I probably won't get a new one because I expect it to be stained again in about a month.<br />  The machine is a little finicky. Removing and placing the water reservoir is a bit of a task (It's not that bad though.. Really. It's just not smooth)<br />Sometimes it has to go in at a certain angle... sometimes you have to remove it and place it back on again for the machine to accept it.. It's a bit of a pain but you'll place it on in about 30 seconds maximum.<br /><br />This is a perfect machine for college students (Expect the fact that it's loud... But. Everything is loud in college.) I do recommend you clean your machine after every milk froth use, you do this by holding down the third button for about 3 seconds... Then it'll get a bit loud while it cleans itself.. This only takes about 10 seconds.<br />If you do not, you will have milk inside of your machine that will get moldy and your machine will be destroyed.<br />If you just use it for espresso then you just need to clean the espresso handle (I recommend doing this about 10 minutes after you've made espresso because it will be VERY hot. However, you can also do this right after. Just run it under cold water and avoid being burnt.). I don't suggest you use soap. A quick rinse under some water does the trick.<br />I do believe that keeping it clean will extend the life of the machine by quite a while. So far I've had mine for two-three months and it's doing pretty well.<br /><br />If you aren't a college kid and you want something a bit more permanent for your home then I recommend you look at other machines. I don't expect my machine to last more than 2 years with proper maintenance. For the price, I'm okay with that. You may be better off buying two separate machines for espresso and milk frothing if you're trying to keep it cheap.<br /><br />Tips! :<br />For better, thick, creamy, strong espresso... I recommend turning your machine on at least 5 minutes before you actually brew the espresso.<br />This ensures the machine will be hot and at a more even temperature. This helps a lot, trust me. The machine does turn off after about 10-15 minutes.. So don't leave it on too long! Five-Seven minutes works amazing.<br /><br />There is no button for JUST brewing milk... but you can do it! All you have to do is press on either the latte or cappuccino button and froth the milk.. After the machine froths the milk it'll usually brew the espresso next. All you have to do is click the button again (Whichever one you clicked before, Latte or Cappuccino.) right after the milk stops brewing. This will cancel the task and so it won't go on to brew some espresso.<br />Ta-Da!

6724,1,"Don't buy this machine if you want to make cappuccino......or anything else.<br /><br />Things I like:  The compact size.<br />Things I dislike:<br />  The cheap quality of materials used in building the machine<br />  The water reservoir cap that is narrower at the top than at the bottom, making it difficult to grip<br />  The ridiculously SHORT steam arm that will not even reach the bottom of a coffee cup, let alone a steam pitcher.<br />  The machine's inability to build up enough pressure to make foam.<br /><br />Since I moved back to the states after living in Italy over 20 years ago, I have made myself espresso and cappuccino everyday at home.  So I do know what I'm talking about when I assess this machine, as I have used several different espresso makers over the years, and used them regularly.  Other than my beloved CMA Genius Commercial 2 group, my next favorite machine is a simple steam driven machine similar to this one.  Only not like THIS one!  Steam machines do require a bit of knowledge and practice to get good results, but they work, they're simple, and they are inexpensive.<br /><br />I purchased this after my old Krups steam machine finally broke (it lasted 10+ years.....and did I say I  used it EVERYDAY!?).  The Mr. Coffee has overall cheapness to it.  The filter basket is thin aluminun and can be dented on the bottom from tapping your coffee grinds out.  The plastic parts are not durable thick plastic, but cheap.<br /><br />The lid is a tapered cone, thicker at the bottom and narrow at the top, with smooth sides.  This doesn't make the machine inoperable, it just requires a really firm finger grip (not great if you have carpal tunnel syndrome - or weaker hands - or are just sleepy or lazy).  My 6' tall muscle-y husband even said it was a pain.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the frothing arm.  Seriously.  The arm itself is 2 INCHES!!  (I measured)  If you are using a thimble to warm your milk in, this will work.  But if you are using even a small froth pitcher, this is totally inadequate.  Even the silly plastic thing that goes over the top of the frothing arm (I guess it's supposed to be some type of froth enhancer, but I have never seen a need or found a use for one of these) only extends the total length to 2.75 inches.<br /><br />As bad as the inept frothing arm, is the machine's ability to produce enough steam to make frothed milk.  If you brew espresso first, when you switch the knob to ""steam"" a weak stream of warm air starts to emit from the froth arm.  I tested to see if more water was needed - filled up the tank to full, brewed espresso, and turned the knob.  The same thing happened.  I tested several different possible causes of the problem and there is just no fix.  If you leave the knob on ""steam"" and keep waiting, (and waiting)  eventually the pressure builds up a little bit, but never to the point of making good foamed milk .... I could hold my fingers directly under the stream of warm air and I wasn't in the least concerned that it might burn me.  Hello - isn't steam supposed to be hot?  It should be called a ""warm air for milk"" arm on this machine.<br /><br />If all you do is make espresso and do not want to froth milk, this machine can get you by;  but better to buy a stove top espresso maker for half the price.  I wouldn't recommend this espresso maker to anyone.<br /><br />Last words:  Don't waste your money!!!

I can get good espresso with good beans. That's the key. I need strong coffee and caffeine!  :-)<br />So, I turned to the Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine. It's a backward engineered version of my former Kyrups 963A. I can use the 963A's carafes and lids. After running a few carafes of water through to clean it, the first batch was good. I like this machine... but I would not bother with black frother attachment which is suppose to help. On both the 963A and the ECM160, you'll have better control of frothing cream/milk without the attachments. Use the metal tip alone like I have for the last 21 years and you'll find it flexible, easy to control and fun at times improvising.<br />I might rate this a 5 star in 3-5 years... if it makes it that long. Some parts are as robust as the 963A. However for 40 dollars, you get what you pay for... and I got something that's worth that amount of money.<br />Time will tell on this one...  My 963A was a 5star+, rest its dear soul.",4,2013-09-06,,True,,Cheaper remake of the Kyrups 963/A,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

The power light would just flash, and nothing would happen. :(  We looked into getting a better one, but it seams to me that unless you want to spend a couple hundred dollars, this makes just as good espresso as the next one.  I don't actually know that, just what I observed from some research.<br /><br />Anyways, this seems to be a good espresso maker for the price.  I figure if you spend twice as much it might not last twice as long, which makes this a good deal.  The new one that we got wasn't put together quite right and the filter seal ... well doesn't seal very well at all.  If the coffee is ground as fine as I like it, the seal pops and espresso and grinds go every where.  I fixed the problem by just bending a paper clip in a circle the same size as the filter and used it as a shim to make the filter seal better.  This is working just fine and it is making great espresso again!<br /><br />Also, I saved the filters from the old maker so we now have two double filters!

Nice to have a reliable machine.<br /><br />*********7/21/2014 - Adding to my review**************************************************************************************************<br />I just wanted to add to this review.  I bought a super expensive machine since I bought this machine.  It grinds the beans, tamps it, when done puts the puck in a bin.  Very nice..  but it doesn't brew a shot with crema like this unit.  It is 1/4 as reliable as this unit, and it costs 10 times more.  Since I brought this to work we brew 4 cups a day on it with coworkers, I haven't de-calcified it once, it just pumps and pumps.  This thing is awesome.  I'm thinking about chucking my super fancy one and just get this one again for home.<br />*******************************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />I tried cheaper models, they are crap.  You need 15 bars of pressure, this one has it!<br /><br />When I brought it home, my wife looked at me kind of strange, I tried making espresso on our steam activated machine and it sucked.. no pressure.<br /><br />So I excitedly unboxed it and made a shot..  delicious.  Made one for my wife... her eyes opened wide.  We were back in Florence Italy, eating cookies and having cappuccino again.<br /><br />Since then.. we make it as much as we can during the week, but since it does take time, we usually make 4 cups a day on the weekends.  2 a piece :)<br /><br />The things works great.  I wish the steam heated up the milk faster but its an entry level machine.  I don't like you have to wait to go from brewing to steaming but.. its an entry level machine.<br /><br />Though it makes good cappuccinos.  Take the plastic thing off of the wand, is sucks and is hard to clean, plus taking it off and putting it on puts a lot of stress on the wand.  Just use the wand.<br /><br />We have used it A LOT.  No problems.  Just be sure to empty the tray, a little water gets purged after every steam cycle and it fills up fast.  No big deal though.<br /><br />Make sure you clean the rim of the contraption you put your grounds in though (portafilter?).  I make sure there are no grounds on it ever, because it can damage the seal ring on the unit, and then the pressure from the steam has a chance to spill out the sides.<br /><br />I only use filtered water also, I think it tastes better.<br /><br />Get a kit.  I have a thermometer, shot glasses (otherwise you are guessing when to shut it off) and something to steam your milk in.  This thing rocks, it pays itself off really quickly, and tastes way better than the crap you get at starbucks.<br /><br />My one gripe and why it doesn't get 5 stars is the grounds.  No matter how hard I tamp them, I think some water drips into them so when you pull out the container to dump the grounds, they are soupy, so I end up banging them against the garbage can and then I have to rinse out the unit.  I wish I could just bang it once, it dumps out as a puck, and I'm off to my next brew.",4,2011-03-31,3.0,,,Great way to see if you like to make your own espresso,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

It is a bit confusing at first with the blinking lights, solid lights, and when exactly I can twist the knob to froth or begin brewing, but I learned within 2 or 3 days.<br /><br />The cappuccinos it makes are delicious. This is a pump driven espresso machine, so the lower temperature doesn't torch the oils making for a delicious crema.<br /><br />I took the rubber frothing tube cap off since I had to take it off all the time anyways and it just seemed gross to leave it on. If you leave it on, you have to take it off anyways in order to clean underneath and clean the rubber tube on the inside of it. I kept it off since it was a pain to keep taking it off as it isn't very easy.<br /><br />After about 2 months of regular use, the frothing tube tip began to slip around and wouldn't screw in properly. I eventually figured out that the threads which attach the tip to the tube were stripped. One which end, I don't know, but all this meant to me was that I couldn't have frothed milk anymore without the tip just rocketing off.<br /><br />I'm figuring out how I can either get replacement parts or get it sent in for repairs. I love this machine too much to just try another one. I'd give the product 5 stars if it weren't for the faulty frothing tube tip.<br /><br />Edit:<br />After contacting the warranty company servicing the espresso machine and getting sent the wrong replacement part, they just sent me a new machine.

6765,1,"I realized I was spending a fortune on lattes so I did A LOT of reseach about espresso makers. I am a student so I couldn't afford much so for the price I think this espresso machine is great! I didn't order it off of Amazon though, I actually went to Walmart because they have a 1 yr replacement plan for $3 and I wanted it right away! I looked at a lot of other people's reviews first and decided that I might as well give it a try for 36.44 (Walmart price) it was worth the risk and if something breaks Walmart sends another one in a couple of days. READ THE DIRECTIONS FIRST! I think this was the most helpful advice on people's reviews; you can burn yourself very badly, make a huge mess or brake the machine if you don't. I can see why a lot of people have broken their machine or had mishaps because it seems like they do take a little finesse. If you live alone, I think this is the perfect machine (no one else around to break it). The only thing I would recommend if you buy this product on amazon is to get the 49mm tamper (fits this machine's filter) and a frothing pitcher because it does not come with either of these. I ended up having to order mine seperate off amazon because most stores don't carry these types of products in stock and if they do they are way too expensive. You can get by without these of course but it was only like $18 for a 12 oz. milk frothing pitcher and the tamper. Cheap appliances can suprise you sometimes. I still have my $8 coffee maker my Mom bought me to move into the dorms with 6 years ago.<br />Hints to using this machine:<br />~Make sure the steam cap is REALLY tight otherwise steam will appear out of the top during use and you can get burned or make a mess.<br />~Do not overfill with water! You have to release the pressure (in the instructions)of the machine before opening the steam cap and it will take forever if you are done making your latte or cappucino and there is still a lot of water left in the reservoir because you have to use the frothing arm to do so.<br />~Everything metal on this machine gets blazing hot even after you turn it off. Don't touch anything until it has cooled down completely, I had shut mine down taken off the steam cap and was wiping the unit down, rested my arm on top and burned the bejesus out of myself by just barely making contact with the metal on top of the water reservoir.<br />~You must have enough water in order to use the steamer. The instructions are very well written and have a troubleshooting section that is very helpful.<br />Good luck with this machine, have had great experience so far, worth the money.",5,2011-06-10,2.0,,,Great machine for the price!

6767,1,"I am the latte drinker in my family and have owned an espresso maker for quite a while.  After years of owning several steam (""el cheapo"") types of machines, I finally bit the bullet and asked for a pump style two years ago for Christmas.  I received a Delonghi and really loved it.  (After all it was a HUGE improvement over what I had owned in the past.) It finally bit the dust in September of this year.  (Not quite two years old... but I do use it everyday, sometimes multiple times...) I did my research and decided to buy this one locally, really because I needed it NOW!  (I mentioned I use it everyday....) My first attempt started rather well, I like the design, the water basin is great, you can remove it, but you don't have to.  The unit heats up very quickly and pulls a great cup of espresso and then the frothing feature is amazing...  I have never owned a more powerful unit.  My Delonghi could froth well, but nothing like this bad boy.  I found that my standard sized frothing pitcher was not near large enough.  I can only froth 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of 1% at a time or I get serious overload.  Since I need a whole cup frothed for my drink, I am having to froth two or three times for one drink.  I understand that this is not the fault of the machine, I am thrilled that it has the power to create froth as well as the coffee houses do.  However, I am concerned about being able to find a larger pitcher that is not too deep as the frothing wand is not very long and extends pretty low on the side of the machine.  This feature alone is not enough to cause my star rating to drop to four.  As I mentioned in my title, this is round two for me.  About three weeks after I purchased my first unit, I had a day when the machine seemed to ""flip out"". I was pulling the shot of espresso, it started sputtering and making a weird noise.  I turned the knob to the off position and pushed the froth button and all seemed to go fine, then I thought I would try to pull another shot just to be sure it was working.  I started over with new beans and all went fine.  So then I went to froth the remaining milk and the frothing feature would not work!

I was able to also receive some mocha powder as well as some flavored syrups to fill my addiction!  My problem is the steam frother.  I also received a small metal pitcher, but it only holds about 8 oz.  Once you begin to froth, it rises up and spills out of the pitcher.  Next step was a larger pitcher.  Now the frothing arm is not long enough.  It also seemed to just take forever to get it to the right consistency.  By the time I brewed the espresso and then frothed the milk, the espresso was cold.  I also didn't like that you needed to refill the reservoir after brewing.  You have to be mighty careful with the blast of steam that escapes.<br /><br />For me, it just isn't worth the hassle to use the frother.

I've experimented with this machine in the last few weeks and I've liked it more and more with each passing day. Here's a tip for those of you who like a frothy cup of cappuccino. Make sure your milk is at room temperature and is not straight from the fridge cold. This machine does not come with a frothing wand so you can't warm the milk up that way and get it to froth. The little milk chute froths the milk and pumps it directly into your cup of coffee. If your milk is cold, the milk chute does not have enough power or heat to froth the milk. What I do is take my milk out from the fridge and heat a little up in a small pan over the stove to get it a little warm and then I pour it into the coffee machine's milk dispenser. This helps it froth up better and the machine sends a perfect stream of hot frothy milk into the waiting cup. Sure it takes a little more time but why rush when you're making yourself a great cup of coffee to start the day :)",5,2017-06-07,7.0,True,,A tip for those who like a frothy cup of cappuccino or latte,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",
6843,1,"This is a great little machine for an amateur.

I was able to make a good cappuccino on the second try (I didn't steam the milk long enough on the first).<br /><br />One note: The instructions say to start steaming the milk once brewing has begun, but it works better if you wait until brewing is almost finished.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, it doesn't take any more time than brewing drip coffee.

6844,1,"First off, I am glad I got this when I did in red as the price went way up now. So watch those price fluctuations.<br /><br />I have had it for about 2 weeks now and used all the options on it. I can't speak to how it will hold up long term as its much to early for that.<br />I did get another tamper as some have suggested and it works better for me. But I think the one that comes with it can also work. I just needed something to grab onto better.<br /><br />I was looking around and comparing machines. I ended up getting this Mr. Coffee for a couple of reasons. I cannot afford an expensive espresso machine and in the entry level market, I think they are all about the same with the 15 bar pumps. So I was looking at those with steamwands and this one. I wanted a machine I can make cappuccinos with and maybe lattes and cortados.<br />The reason I settled on this one instead of one with a wand is the amount of milk used. I am the only one that makes milk based drinks and with a wand, one has to put a certain amount in a separate container and that milk is then used up. With this machine, it only dispenses what you need. So if I make a small cappuccino or a cortado, it uses not very much milk. And the rest of the milk stays fresh and untouched and goes back in the fridge. Its less wasteful for my uses I believe. For a cortado for example, I make so little milk that it would not work with a wand. You have to put in to a certain level on those.<br /><br />Its also nice not having to fiddle with a wand and just pressing a button and it does it all for you.<br /><br />I have a good grinder already as I also use other methods of making coffee still. Aeropress, pourover, etc. I got this for making milk drinks mostly. So I use fresh whole beans for this just like I do for my other methods. My husband likes the bustelo I got so I could get the espresso grind just right on my grinder.<br /><br />When I first got it I did the priming which too 3 tries. Then I did the vinegar cleanse as I saw one reviewer describe. Can't hurt to get all the factory oils and grime out of the pipes in any case. After that I played with the weight and grind. I always weigh my beans and I can fit 7 grams in the small holder and 14 grams in the large. That works out best for me. I had a few were I either tamped too hard or had a too fine grind and nothing came out. Just stop the machine and go courser or don't tamp so hard.<br /><br />You can either let the machine do it all with one button press, or you can make a espresso first, do the manual milk in a separate container and then pour it over the espresso. I do that when I make cortados. That way you can swirl the milk and have less bubbles in it. So you can easily make froth to put on top of hot chocolate. I made some to put in my Pero drink, which is a grain based non coffee drink.<br />Besides the presets there are manual options for the espresso, so if you want you can hold the button down and it puts up to 5 ounce of extra on the shot. I suppose to can hit it twice and make a larger cup. But I prefer to make americanos. Make the espresso and then pour hot water over it from the kettle. It does work though holding the espresso button if that is what you prefer to get the hot water that way. The other manual button is the froth, which you also activate by holding the button for 3 seconds. Just be careful to watch that as it just keeps coming out for like 30 seconds. I walked away the first time and my big mug overflowed like crazy. Just hit the button again to make it stop.<br /><br />So its pretty flexible outside of the presets.<br /><br />It cleans quite easy. I always run a cleaning cycle through the milk wand. It takes 30 seconds and at the same time I clean the portafilter. That is pretty much it. Wipe the wand and put the milk container back in the fridge.<br />And from time to time I run a empty portafilter to clean out the grinds from underneath and wipe around a bit.<br /><br />It does what I wanted it to do. I still have my pour over coffees or my aeropress, but I like to have a couple of milk based drinks during the day. When I get really fancy I put some syrups in it. I like the sugar free Monin ones for that.<br /><br />I also got me a knockbox for all the grinds. I don't really want to smack it on my garbage can and I don't want to put them in the sink.

6845,1,"let me start off by saying, we drink LOTS of latte/cappuccino in our house, we go through them like TPs. our first starter espresso machine Krups XP1000 (less than 50 bucks) lasted us little over 2 years, our previous De'Longhi EC155 (80 bucks) lasted us 2 years, and looks like this Mr Coffee ECMP1000 (mid one hundred bucks) died just after 1.5 years. sigh...... why don't things last these days. i keep thinking maybe the more expensive i go up the ladder, maybe they'll stop dying and last a bit longer.<br /><br />Aside from using the deep cleaning feature everytime after we finished using it, we also regularly clean this thing by taking the frothing tubing portion of the module apart, because the frothing portion of the machine does clog up after about 20 cups, without cleaning the internal tubings, the ratio/portion of the milk would be off. The procedure isn't hard, you just have to remember how you take it apart so you can put it back together. unfortunately, after 1.5 years, seems like the internal pump that's dedicated to the frothing steam isn't working anymore. it stopped sucking up milk and sounds like the pump isn't priming anymore. i suspect it's dual pump setup with one for espresso, one for froth. the espresso portion of the pump still works, although sounds pretty rough too the last time we used it.<br /><br />we go through 4~5 cups a day, X 365 days and X 1.5 year = 2,737 cups MTBF (or mean ""cup"" before failure).<br /><br />this may be ok for the casual drinkers, but those who go through lattes heavily like we do, i recommend steer away and look elsewhere.<br /><br />when it worked, the ease and convenience is nice. you can pretty much set it to amount of froth you want, either latte or cappuccino, and just walk away, and come back in about a min and everything is done. only thing is you can't mix the sugar in with the froth before hand like a manual frothing machine could. you would just have to put the sugar in after everything is done and stir.<br /><br />for a steam based espresso machine, which tend to be cheap for beginners, i could be forgiving in their longevity, but for pump based machines, 1.5 years is just ridiculous.<br /><br />on to the next. ..",1,2018-10-28,3.0,True,,"requires regular cleaning, died after 1.5 years","Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

Just a little bit over the eighty cups they recommend a cleaning at for those of us with hard water.<br /><br />Anyway, I (sorta) followed the deliming instructions, ran a half gallon of vinegar through it using both the espresso and cleaning cycles, and the latte setting on the frother works again.<br /><br />And for those of you who are wary... this thing works great! My wife isn't a coffee snob, but this machine is helping her to become one. She's (mostly) sworn off that overpriced star place's coffee, as she's come to find it's very bitter, unless there's a pound of sugar in it, then it's too sweet. While the Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista doesn't have all sorts of fancy features as you may see in more expensive models, this bad boy reliably delivers what it promises, and can save you tons of money! Just think... We've spent maybe $100 on espresso pre-ground coffee, $300 on cocoa (it's good cocoa) & syrups. Compare that with the, at very least, $4/cup, and we're looking at $540 for 660 cups with the Mr. Coffee, compared to $2,640+ for coffee from that star place.

6850,1,"Purchased for an anniversary gift for my wife.  She likes the machine a lot, largely because it is very easy to use and the espresso drinks taste fine.  The removable milk container is great as it can just go in and out of the refrigerator as needed.  After a month of use, the little plastic clip broke on the filter assembly.  It isn't a critical piece, so the machine functions fine.  However, contacting Mr. Coffee to see if it would be covered under warranty was an exercise in futility.  Submit email.  Get an automated reply with a reference number.  Never hear back.  Repeat.  I tried chatting, but it must have been too close to closing time, because they kept cancelling out my chat sessions until live chat was closed for the day.  Fortunately, I have a Square Trade warranty on the machine so if anything else breaks I will be able to go through them.  It's a good starter machine and worth it at the $99-$150 price point, but not for any higher price than that.  (They have a new version selling at $329... yikes.)

6851,1,"This machine gets 4 stars, given that it's also only $40. In other words, I didn't have high expectations, so it's a pleasant surprise that it works at all! The short review is that it makes a perfectly acceptable shot for a latte; but the quality isn't high enough to sip it as an espresso. And it does a fine job of steaming milk.<br /><br />The good:<br />• the machine itself is small, lightweight and easy to clean. Plus it was quite inexpensive, as espresso machines go!<br />• It's a pretty simple process to make a latte. I've never owned any other machine like this, so maybe others are just as simple.<br />• the steamer makes nice hot milk with decent foam (I actually use almond milk, so I can't say what it would do with regular milk)<br />• after 10 days of practicing, I've figured out how to get a shot that produces a darn tasty morning latte.<br /><br />The bad:<br />• it takes a LONG time to pull a shot (3 minutes?); and even when I'm only making a single 2-ounce shot, the machine slows down twice, tempting me to believe it's finished even though I have less than 2 oz of espresso in the carafe. But no, if I just wait patiently it does eventually produce a full 2 oz of espresso.<br />• the steamer arm is poorly designed. It only sticks out about an inch from the machine, so you can't move it around much in your cup of milk. Another reviewer had recommended tossing the black casing right from the outset, so I did that too. Never even tried using it.<br />• the shot produced by this machine doesn't have any crema at all<br />• the cleaning instructions were insufficient: the first 3 shots I pulled, after having cleaned the machine, left a bit of white powder on top of the coffee grounds.<br /><br />A few usage tips:<br /><br />• The directions say to start by brewing your shot but then switch to steam in the middle, and then go back to finish pulling your shot after your milk is hot. That seems crazy to me so instead this is what I do: When I first turn the machine on, I start with it in the steam position. I do this after having poured my milk into a mug. While the machine is heating up, I measure out my coffee and attach the little basket to the machine. As soon as steam starts coming out, I began heating and frothing my milk. This takes about 60 seconds, for 6-8 ounces of cold milk. Once my milk is nice and hot I switch the knob to brew.<br /><br />• As I mentioned above, the machine acts like it's finished before the full shot has been produced. Not only does any espresso stop dripping out into the carafe, but the machine belches out a fair amount of steam, which I always thought was a sign it was done. But no, if you just wait patiently the machine starts up again (it takes about 20 seconds, so it's REALLY tempting to give up) and eventually produces a full shot.",4,2018-04-15,3.0,True,,"An acceptable espresso maker, given that it's only 40 bucks","Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

Works well in tandem. I clean the tubes according to instructions, about once a week. I also hand wipe the espresso area maybe every two weeks.<br /><br />I decided customer service is pretty good.

So I would have expected at least a little crema.<br /><br />The beaker has a marking at the equivalent of a double shot, however it is not marked as that. Twice that marking is marked as 2 cups, and the next marking is 4 cups. However if you do make that much coffee, expect it to be fairly diluted - to be fair, I would expect any espresso machine to make diluted coffee if you make 8 shots from a single basket of ground coffee. The beaker also contains a lid that makes it easy to center the beaker below the nozzle, however I am not sure that this is needed. The lid (if put on correctly) results in the coffee markings being off-center. Hardly a big deal.<br /><br />This machine does not have a water reservoir, and I have mixed feelings about this. My (far more) expensive machine had one, and that meant I would only fill up with filtered water once a week, or could fill up on the fly if we drank more coffee than normal. However this machine requires a refill of water each brew, and it is important to ensure that the pressure has been released before taking the cap off totally - fortunately the cap seems to have been designed so that it starts releasing pressure long before you could possibly get the cap off.<br /><br />While I have put everything through the dishwasher, the shiny metallic sheen on the holder for the coffee basket is paint on top of a not-so-shiny metal, and that paint does not survive the dishwasher. Do not expect it to be shiny afterwards. :-)<br /><br />While it seems that I have posted a fair few negative comments, every single one of them is extremely minor nit-picking. At the end of the day, it is the espresso itself that matters, and this makes a good brew.",4,2011-08-20,2.0,True,,Good machine for the price,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",
6896,1,"Look, if you're the type of person who will be bothered by not having a stainless steel grinds tamper, do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive European machine.  You'll be happier in the end.  But if you don't care about aesthetics, then this is an excellent little espresso machine.  I can't speak to longevity, as I've only had it about two months, but in that time I've used the machine almost daily and never had a problem.  I can't even see the pressure dropping off although it's probably about time to do a cleaning.  I've been using distilled water which is supposed to let you go longer between running a vinegar solution through.  Milk steamer works great, though I haven't used it that often.  Perfect crema.<br /><br />All in all, given the relative lower price of the Mr. Coffee, this has been a great purchase.  Much better than a steam-based system and the coffee tastes great.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I am taking two stars off my original review as this machine seems to have problems over time.  After about six months, we got the blinking green lights of death, even though there was no blockage or other obvious mechanical problem.  Warranty was honored and the manufacturer sent a new unit.  That one lasted less than eight months before it too died with the mysterious blinking lights.

6901,1,"I purchased this unit  about a week ago and I decided to write a review that targets a very specific audience.<br /><br />If you really enjoy Espresso, Cappuccino or even a Latte and you don't like having to pay the high cost of purchasing them from your local coffee shop...AND if you don't have a lot of money to invest in equipment...then this review was written for you.<br /><br />For the money...you will not find a better Espresso machine out there.  This is by far the best value on the market as of today (12/2012).<br />I started off with an Aeropress and a hand powered burr grinder from Kyocera that made a very very good substitute for Espresso.  And my wife and I were very happy with that system.  But we found that the time involved kept us from enjoying our morning Espresso as often as we would have liked and I ended up going out pretty often to a local shop when I felt the need.<br /><br />So I began reading reviews online, watching youtube videos and talking to folks to see what my options were.  I was pretty pleased to find out that I did have an affordable option available to me..and so I took the plunge.<br /><br />From Amazon I purchased a Baratza Encore grinder ($130), Mr. Coffee ECMP50 ($80), and an Espresso Tamper.  I already had an Aerolatte milk frother (Highly recommended).<br /><br />The combination of this equipment produces an outstanding result that is better than a lot of local shops in my area...and probably yours too!  If you can afford to spend $250 then THIS is the way to go...and I can assure you that you will not be disappointed in the result.<br /><br />Go out to a local coffee roaster and get a recommended Espresso blend whole bean (FRESH is BEST).  Grind it in the Baratza Encore at the 9 setting for the Mr. Coffee ECMP50 and follow the directions to produce the Espresso.  Pour milk into your coffee cup and get it hot in the microwave....then use the Aerolatte milk frother to almost double it in volume.  Add your flavorings and sweetener as desired and then pour the Expresso into it to enjoy a WONDERFUL treat.<br /><br />Now think about it...if you just spend $4 per drink and buy just 2 per week (1 for you and 1 for your wife) you will spend $416 per year.  With the system above you can produce two drinks EVERY DAY for less than $600 for the YEAR (INCLUDING THE COST OF COFFEE BEANS and MILK!)  And even if you have to replace the Mr. Coffee every year....you still come out on top of the deal!<br />So you get 7X the coffee at just a little bit more cost than going to a local shop for just 1 per week.  How can you beat that deal?<br /><br />Having said all this I again HIGHLY RECOMMEND this system for those who can spend $250 on their equipment and who love Espresso/Cappuccino/Latte drinks.  You will NOT be disappointed, I promise you.  Life is too short to not enjoy a good Espresso/Cappuccino/Latte...and the economy is too bad to go to your local shop on a regular basis.  So make the plunge now and give YOURSELF a present that you will enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />*** 1 Month update ****<br />Everything is still going strong and I have had ZERO problems.  The one thing that I now realize is that I should have taken into account the cost associated with cleaning the grinder and Espresso Maker.  There are a few options that you can run through your grinder to clean the parts that are not designed to be easily removed for cleaning...but I have not chosen one for recommendation yet.  Once I do, I will refactor the the costs shown above and amend them.  The cost of cleaning the Espresso machine can be mitigated by using quality water and following the cleaning recommendations in the manual.<br />I do not expect for the additional cost of cleaning to significantly reduce the value....but it is something that should be taken into consideration, as proper cleaning will increase the life span of your equipment and therefore reduce the cost per serving over the performance period.<br /><br />*** 10 Month update ***<br />Well, we have been using this machine for almost a year now and it is going strong.  I just cleaned it for the first time to get ready for the fall, when our latte drinking increases.<br />I still highly recommend this machine if you are looking for something in the sub $300 range.  Save your money for a good grinder and go with this machine.  Quality ingredients, good water, and investing in a good grinder and you are all set to save big $$ while making drinks better than you can buy at Starbucks!<br /><br />**** 32 Month update ****<br />This machine is still are big part of our family routine...and is going strong.  I have heard of folks who have had issues with this machine, but can attest that mine is still working great.  Again, maintenance is a big part of ensuring that the system operates trouble free.  AND, using good quality water.  It is easier to NOT gum up the machine, than to have to descale it constantly!<br /><br />While this has been a staple in my home, I am now making the plunge into a more expensive espresso maker.  Having gone from prepping for 1 - 2 frequently during the week to 3 every single day, I feel that I can justify the expense of a step up machine that is designed to take that kind of production.  But I will always remember this machine, like a first love, it go me though my initial exploration into the wonderful world of espresso.

After reading the manual I found that I had not been cleaning the steaming arm well enough. This would be my only complaint, it is very difficult to get the steaming arm completely clean each time. You would need to essentially do a deep cleaning of the arm immediately after each use to keep it perfectly clean. This would mean risking a burn (as the steaming arm is incredibly hot at this point) and by the time you would be done cleaning your drink would be cold. Overall, this machine does do the trick.

It's useless unless you want to easily grow bacteria. Plus don't let you do a professional frothing<br />-After frothing, blow a little steam out the wand so no milk dries and clogs it.

If you brew a double-shot, the average mug will nearly overflow, and there isn't enough room for most thermoses.

When making at home we used the steam espresso makers for many years. The espresso was OK, but the crema was thready and short lived.<br /><br />My first ECMP50 lasted about two years. I always had to worry about over packing the grounds or getting them too fine and at times would have to start over because the machine was unable to pump the water through the grounds. I always wondered why it couldn't get the water through the grounds as most machines are the 15 bar variety.<br /><br />I bought my current machine 3 years and 1 month ago. This machine works much better (the other was weak in the pressure category) and I can tamp the grounds and not worry about the fineness of the grind. I use a Capresso burr grinder on the large end of the Extra Fine setting.<br /><br />My wife and I each pull a double espresso shot every day. She prefers no-froth latte and I like my cappuccino. When friends are over they usually like a cappuccino. I have an out-of-town friend who spends every week day morning at his local Starbucks with his cronies and says the caps I make are as good or better than theirs and he usually has two.<br /><br />I do very little maintenance on this. Just an occasional cleaning of the drip area of the machine where the grounds come in contact with it.<br /><br />I fill my coffee cup a hair under half with milk and use the frothing tube without the rubber tip.

I did a lot of research, and was tempted to buy a capsule machine, but after trying out pretty much everything out there I was not a fan, because then you either have to get a separate milk frother, or use the dry milk capsules, and you don't get the coffee you like because you're typically stuck with a limited selection of capsules and certain brands only accept certain ones.  I love to be able to use my own espresso, whether it's starbucks, illy, lavazza, etc. and my own organic milk. It's just great - you can customize the amount of espresso, and You can adjust the froth while it frothes to get either more foam or more milk.  Or just push a button and it does premeasured amounts, which I found out are just right for me.  And you can use pods if you don't want to make a mess pouring coffee.<br /><br />I do recommend running the machine through a couple of times with water, otherwise you'll get a little bit of plastic taste - being brand new - it is to be expected.<br />I'm also pleasantly surprised that it is not loud at all.

Once you start making your own at home, nothing else will taste the same. A few tips that I've learned with this machine:<br /><br />1. Get rid of that useless rubber tube. It is much easier to use and clean with out it<br />2. Have your beans ground fresh and fairly fine and keep them stored in a sealed container. Make sure to use the proper serving, but pack it really tight...trust me this works!<br />3. Froth your milk first before running the espresso. The steam may take a bit longer to get going than the hot water. I usually pack in my beans, then froth the milk to about 165-170 degrees (make  sure the milk is cold before starting to froth), then run the espresso.<br /><br />4. Frothing milk takes practice, so don't be discouraged if you don't get it right the first time<br />5. Buy a small stainless steal canter with a thermostat to froth your milk. I picked mine up at Target<br /><br />Also, keep a clean wet rag or paper towel near by to clean the steam nozzle after frothing, it'll get baked on very quickly!<br /><br />I've worked in fine dinning for a long time , so I've gotten pretty good at making espresso.<br /><br />For those of you thinking of getting a starter or a mid range espresso machine....this is a winner!!!",5,2009-09-21,,,,The best 70 bucks I've ever spent!!!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

7060,1,"I had to return a pump driven espresso maker that stopped working after 5 brews, and the question came up again: do I really need a pump driven system (in general a more complex system, and more expensive system, and more failure prone system), or will a steam driven system work for me? The main reason for a pump as I understand, is the keep the brew temperature somewhat below the boiling point so as to get the best tasting coffee, quoted as 92-96 degrees C (197.6-204.8 F). Now, how important that is, or how discerning a taste you have to have to be able to tell the difference, or how important the temperature variable is compared to the type of coffee bean your are using, e.t.c. I do not know. (But I am certain it's  discussed in some blog out there.) At sea level under normal condition the water boiling point is about 212 degree F. At the elevation my coffee is being brewed (5500ft) the boiling point is 202 F. As a steam coffee maker builds up pressure the steam temperature has to rise. But how much pressure is needed (and how much will the temperature rise?) The pump driven espresso maker specifications mention 15 bar or 217.5 psi! That certainly is a very high value, a nonsense value used by marketing (your car tires run on 25 to 50 psi). I would think that 5 to 10 psi would do the trick. (To test this wild guess one could mount a 12 ft -generating about 5 psi- pvc tube filled with water over the coffee basket and time a shot). To generate 5 psi at my altitude of 5500ft a steam machine would have to raise brewing water temperature by about 15 degree F above boiling temperature. (from tables published on the Web I figured a (Delta F/delta psi)=3). Boiling temperature here is 202, add the 15 and get 217 degree F, which is 12 F above the supposed ideal brewing range of 198 to 205. And ist somewhat more than a drip coffee maker uses at seal level. So, no clear answer and some guess work. But a placement of a steam machine at high altitude goes in the right direction.<br />Now to my Mr. Coffee steam espresso maker, especially what I like about it (other than the very modest price): A coffee basket large enough to brew up to four shot/cups worth of espresso, just right for us two. Due to this amount no heating-up-run of the machine is required. Generates enough pressure to use rather fine grind with slight tamping. You can measure the amount of water into the boiler and thus need not attend the process to stop the flow. The coffe basket seal does not accumulate coffe ground and/or is easy to clean. Negatives? I figured to remove the plastic tube covering the steam wand as it really inhibits proper steam jet action and only causes a nasty sounding bubbling action. And be very careful when you open the lid of the water reservoir when the machine is hot. In the instructions it says ""release the pressure first"" but I cannot figure out how to do that. When I open the steam wand to release pressure the boiler turns on at the same time. So you would have to unplug the machine first (what a nuisance). So I protect my hand with a potholder. It helps to be somewhat ambidextrous so that you can operate the steam/brew selector on the left and the pressure vessel lid on the top, both requiring a bit of strength. Those knobs have an interesting shape, almost ergonomic.",4,2011-07-12,,True,,Steam or pump driven espresso maker?,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

7063,1,I have had my product for 14 months. I read all the reviews before I purchased. Yes there are glitches but since I paid 200.00 I was determined to make it work out and last a while. First thing that happened - I primed it like it said butt..sometimes when you fill the water reservoir it still leaked all over the place and I couldn't get it to stop. Prime it again It may take a couple times. I also filled it when it was pumping and had suction and lightly pressed down on tank to secure seal..that seemed to really work it hasn't leaked in weeks. Months later something else just developed. I cleaned it with waterfall the time like directions said but it still clogged and wouldn't suck the water up this morning. ugh. like me you love your coffee and it wasn't happening. I didn't give up. Place white vinegar in milk container and run on manual froth 2x or until it starts to flow. This worked for me. Remember to run clear water thru until vinegar smell no longer present.BTW my clean cycle no longer works thats why froth cycle worked. I am writing this with excellent cup of coffee in hand.

Generally most pumps will retain water depending on the type of pump it will retain a lot of water or a little water in the pump base..  What appears to happen as the pressure is released this water drains out to the drip tray and then over flows depending on the amount present. and it may leak out on the bottom holes of the unit as well.<br /><br />The fix<br />Like any good  pump care, one should drain the pump when finished.<br />To do this remove the water holder from the back of the unit, and pour the remaining water out. so the holder is empty.<br />Press the Steam button on the front of the unit.  Wait for the green steam light to become solid<br />Turn the function knob to steam, you will have quite a bit of water left in the pump that will steam off<br />Turn the control knob back to the center position once the steamer quits steameaning.<br />Turn  off the power  switch so the pump doesn't run empty.<br />This will empty the pump totally of water.<br /><br />Keep in mind doing this will mean you will have to prime the pump each first use of the machine again. by  pressing the steam button  and turning the control knob to steam and letting the pump pull in fresh water from your filled holder.<br /><br />But this should get rid of the water issue if you totally empty the pump and holder after each use.<br /><br />P.S make sure you have a cup under the steamer!<br /><br />When priming the pump let it steam for about 30 to 60 seconds.",5,2009-09-25,17.0,,,Solved Leak issue some people report,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Automatic Dual Shot",

But, I like a shot of espresso every now and then and it satisfies me and my budget, but I wouldn't rely on it if that's all I drank and had money to throw around.<br />- The milk steamer's a little awkward, it's not long enough and doesn't extend that far away from the machine, but, it's not a deal breaker.<br />- Doesn't come with a tamper.  Buy one.  It'll make a world of difference.<br />- It took me absolutely ages to get the plastic smell/taste out of my coffee.  A minor annoyance.

7110,1,"I have been using the Mr. Coffee Espresso maker to make lattes for my wife for two years now.  I have earned serious marriage points and the family coffee funds are not in the red!<br /><br />I bought the unit at Target for $25 - on sale. The first unit soon failed to heat and was returned.  The replacement has worked without a problem if cleaned properly (see below).  Mr. Coffee makes a more modern looking unit that might use the same internals - if you want a different look for about the same $40 price.  It lacks the top surface to store parts.<br /><br />What follows are some functional characteristics I have discovered during continued use, Then I detail the procedure I have developed.<br /> - The steamer will work after the espresso is made without needing additional water.  I presume that the outlet from the tank going to the espresso plate is above the level of the bottom of the tank.  This leaves you with pressure and water to steam milk for the latte.  Don't open the top of the machine while it is hot and pressurized.<br /><br />- Get a tamper that fits the cup and compress the grounds.  I started with using the spoon, then a spice jar and then got an aluminum tamper and milled the circumference until it fit deep enough.<br /><br />- The foaming arm will clog unless cared for.  If the steamed milk is not rinsed from the arm and plastic cover it will get suctioned up into the arm as the steam/air cools.  Once dried, you are in for a serious clog.<br /><br />My Procedure for a one cup (10-11 fl oz) latte:<br />- I measure carbon filtered cold water from the fridge with the included carafe.  Halfway between the ""2"" and the ""4"" lines.  Don't overfill the tank.<br />- Very Fine (Turkish or espresso) ground espresso blend or other dark roasted coffee is required.  I fill the filter basket with a bit over one scoop and use my tamp to firmly compact the grounds.  I have started to add a few drops of water to moisten the grounds to improve the proportion of crema the unit produces.  Unlike typical units - the heating element does not heat unless the valve is opened to the basket or the steaming arm.  It empties when enough pressure builds up to make it flow. ***If the grounds are too porous, then pressure doesn't build up enough to create much crema at all.*** I turn the unit off when the carafe fills to the '2' mark - if the tank started with the right amount of water then steam is what is coming out of the espresso side.  But there is still water available for steaming below the water outlet. Do not open the tank because it is pressurized with steam.<br />- Start foaming milk/soy/cream etc.  The plastic cover recirculates the milk outside the nozzle helping to create more froth.  While I am doing this with my right hand I empty a coffee cup of hot water used to prewarm it and empty the espresso into the cup.  There is still time to empty and rinse the basket and fill the carafe with water to rinse the foaming head.  I stop foaming milk when it gets too hot to touch/hold the stainless foaming pitcher towards the botttom.  The milk should be starting to foam nicely at this temperature.<br />-Immediately steam the water in the carafe to rinse the nozzle so it doesn't clog with dried cooked milk.  I pull the black cover off and use a brush and the carafe together to clean the scalded milk from the nozzle before it becomes rock hard - saves time to do it immediately.<br />-Pour the foamed milk into the cup with the espresso and dash the foam on top.

7118,1,"This is a mixed review.  The five stars are deserved by the Mr. Coffee franchise for their prompt replacement of a cappuccino maker that failed after approximately 2 months of service.  In fact, I may have been at fault by not turning off/unplugging the machine after use, as stated in the user guide.  The replacement works fine and I have found no need to buy or grind coffee beans to make a great cup of coffee.  In fact, I use regular grind arabica beans, right out of the can and they make an aromatic, delicious, strong cup of coffee every time.  I have only used the steamer side of the machine one time and it seemed to work just fine.  Lattes are not my particular preference.  Now, to the balance of my review.  I originally bought this machine several months before I actually put it to use.  When it failed, I frankly expected to have to &#34;eat&#34; the machine (kudos to Mr. Coffee), so I ordered a second one.  It arrived and was put into service right away and it continues to work just fine.<br />What is troubling, tho, is the fact that I am certain both machines I received from Amazon had previously been rejected and returned by other customers. The first machine arrived, packaged with a stainless steel 1-cup measure that makes brewing easier.  However, according to the product carton and the printed instructions, no such cup was included in the packaging.??  The second machine arrived with no stainless cup and also no coffee measure, which I am certain the Chinese would not have failed to include.<br />When buying products from a mass marketeer, such as Amazon, you should expect to be on the receiving end of previously returned merchandise, once in a while.  However, it should be made a point to include all originally furnished parts, accessories and instructions as was originally packaged.  So Boo to Amazon on this issue. No actual problem, tho.

7122,1,I purchased this locally since my other machine that I have had for over 10 years gave out and I needed something quick.  First I would say take the little black plastic piece of the frothing wand off. All it did was make a mess.  Otherwise this machine makes a great latte. I use rice milk for mine and it makes foam just fine.  I would ad a tip if anyone has a problem with the steam wand not working as usually; You have to take it off and clean it with some vinegar once in awhile.  Mine didn't seem to steam very well last week so I had to stop in the middle of making my coffee and clean the tip out. I think milk can get stuck in there since the hole is a little bigger than a needle.

7135,1,"I bought this espresso maker for my wife as a gift. I chose this product because it seems to offer the most bang for your buck in terms of features.<br /><br />As I was researching espresso machines, I started to notice that a lot of the machines seemed time consuming. I have also heard many stories about families that have dumped big $$$ into an espresso machine, then stopped using it because it was too time consuming to actually make yourself a beverage. (I remember the first home espresso machine I ever saw in person. It took the owner 20+ minutes to make me a drink. I remember thinking that seemed ridiculous. I also remember that espresso machine sitting unused for years after the novelty wore off.) Knowing how busy my family is, I did not want to fall into this same boat.<br /><br />The Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista is great for a busy family. I can turn it on, press a few buttons, then return a few minutes later to a fresh brewed delicious espresso beverage. Not only is it convenient, but the beverage tastes great too. After you have finished brewing the beverage, cleanup is a breeze. Again, push a button, then the machine is cleaned. Also, the milk container easily separates from the machine and can be placed in the fridge to keep your milk fresh. I'm sure other espresso machines are great (and they better be for the price) but this one won out, hands down, in the convenience department.<br /><br />Another feature that was important to me was I DID NOT want a pod based machine. I have a pod based coffee maker, and the truth is we don't use it because the pods are really expensive. Yes it is convenient, but the cost will eat through the average checking account just about as quickly as a daily run to your favorite coffee spot. Also, many of the pod based espresso makers require two pods (coffee and dairy) to make your beverage (see MORE $$$)! It is not a big deal to get coffee beans ground for an espresso machine, then tamp your grounds into the machine.<br /><br />A few other thoughts. The machine comes with a recipe book. I've tried a few, they are delicious (Nutella Latte!). You can brew a single or double shot! The machine feels quality built and very durable. The machine is loud, but I would imagine anything including a milk steamer would be (just imagine how loud they are at Starbucks, now imagine that in your kitchen). If you can't stand noisy appliances, I would avoid this machine. Tamping your own espresso can be messy until you get used to it. Be prepared to spill some grounds and such as you learn.<br /><br />The bottom line is, I believe this machine will put an end to our ritualistic weekend Starbucks runs. I did the math. This machine will pay for itself within a couple months.",5,2013-05-15,243.0,,,Great Espresso Machine for a great value!,"Color: Silver<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: Espresso/Cappuccino Maker",

I went to run t with water through its process and the switch broke while switching from brew to steam.  Inspecting closely I could see the internals of the switch knob was just thin plastic.

I can now make hot mocha latte's comparable to the dunkin donuts ones (almost as good as paneras).  I did buy a tamper to pack down the coffee grinds. At first it's a little confusing (directions are bad) - on how to use the frother. Here's what I do...fill the water up to the 2cup mark and then a little more water (this is what you'll use to steam). Turn to brew, when once espresso hits the 2cup mark on pot, switch it to off. Then get your milk cup ready to froth and turn the dial to steam. Problem is you never know how much extra water to add to get the right amount of steam. I also think it's a pain to clean up the frother.<br /><br />So here's what I do to make a delicious hot mocha latte:<br />1. fill pot up to 2cup mark with water, pour in water reservoir<br />2. use tamper to pack down ground espresso beans (lavazza is good, 6.99/can at grocery store)<br />3. turn to brew<br />4. meanwhile, heat my milk in coffee mug (2/3 full in 16oz cup) - in microwave about 1:45/2min.<br />5. add a teaspoon of davinci chocolate sugar free syrup (or similar, like torani) to my hot milk cup<br />6. then pour in espresso and stir<br />YUM!<br /><br />Whole thing takes about 4 min and clean up is a breeze.

7243,1,"There's a reason this item is a fraction of the price of other coffee makers: it's cheap garbage. The gaskets are inadequate to hold the steam pressure during brewing, steam frequently leaks out the top, and on one occasion the filter assembly started to loosen itself. It would not surprise me in the least if this thing blew up in my face. As for the quality of the coffee it brews: it just ain't espresso. Espresso should have crema, a frothy 'head' like in a glass of beer. Espresso should be viscous and bittersweet, with a distinct texture different from pour over coffee. This machine does not make proper espresso, just very strong drip coffee.<br />Also the milk steamer is poorly designed, it has a sort of vented sleeve that goes over the actual wand; milk builds up in the space between, and turns into a gross brown scum after just a couple of uses.<br />Save some money and buy a proper espresso maker; I wish I had.",1,2016-04-10,7.0,True,,Seemed too good to be true...,"Color: Cappuccino<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Style Name: 4-Cup Steam",

I love being able to offer my guests quality lattes while we are visiting. Some of the cons say it leaks water and I found that mine did too; but only if you leave the water container filled.

It is as close as you will get to an automatic espresso maker without spending hundreds or thousands more. All you do is fill the filter and push your desired button. The milk frothes excellent and the espresso extracts perfectly. I tend to use pre-ground espresso such as Illy and Lavazza (I look for sales), or a lesser known brand named Dalmeyer (sp?) from Germany. It fits a full size mug for my double latte or cappuccino and I don't have to mess with the milk anymore. After I finish my cup, I put it back under the machine, turn the milk valve to ""clean"", run the clean cycle and put the milk container back in the fridge. I was in Macy's and I saw a Nespresso machine (which uses pods) with an almost identical milk frothing unit, but the cost was $599!

7279,1,"I've owned one of these machines for almost three years now. It makes great espresso with wonderful crema and is very easy to use. Although others have experienced leaking problems, I have not. I've never had a problem with it that could not be solved by a good cleaning with vinegar. So, why only two stars?<br /><br />There is no way to buy a replacement filter basket. The bottom of the metal perma filter is two seperate but attached layers - a top layer with many small perforations that allow water through, but keep coffee grounds in, and a bottom layer with one slightly larger hole in the center to allow the espresso out. The top layer has separated after three years of use, and the perma filter is impossible to use now because it gets clogged almost immediately, causing the seal to break and water to pour out around the sides when I try to make an espresso. I would completely understand that this small part has a limited lifespan, happily buy a replacement and give this product full stars - except that it is absolutely impossible to replace this simple part. Mr. Coffee does not have replacements available. The only replacement espresso filter they make will not fit this model, and I can find no others that will work with it. I even personally contacted the company, only to be told yep, I'm right, this part isn't available for separate purchase. So, because a $7 part is broken, I will have to pay for a completely new espresso machine. How does this make sense at all? At least I got 3 years out of it, but since the filter basket is small, it would also be an easy part to lose. Since there's no convenient place to store the basket on this model, if you keep the filter basket in a kitchen drawer, this is a distinct possibility. Imagine that you spent $80 on this thing, lost the filter basket after a couple of weeks, and then what?<br /><br />I would happily buy another one of these based on performance and size (ability to put a mug underneath the spout, ability to make more than one shot of quality espresso at a time). But, I just can't give Mr. Coffee my money again in good conscience. The machine still WORKS, why should I have to buy another one just to get this one part? It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of, and it really deserves only one star because of this huge marketing flaw, but I've loved this machine for so long that I just can't do it.

Many machines that are powerful take a long time to warm up. I turn this on, and by the time I've gathered my ingredients, it's ready to go.<br />3. A standard-size coffee cup fits under the drip spout.<br /><br />Those were the reasons I purchased it.  I discovered several other nice features after buying it.<br /><br />1. It's very easy to use. The manual itself is helpful, and the instructions are easy to do. My 9-year-old son regularly makes me lattes with this machine.<br />2. Even though it's tall enough to fit a standard mug, it's not bulky or oversized.<br />3. Everything except the frothing wand is easy to clean.<br />4. It's very economical.<br /><br />I'm really trying to think of any ""cons,"" and the only ones I can come up with are:<br />1. You don't get any accessories with it (except the tamper), but then, most of the machines don't come with those anyway.<br />2. Although a standard coffee mug will fit under the spout, novelty mugs that are just a little taller won't.<br /><br />Other reviews say that they've had problems with leaks. I haven't.<br /><br />A hint if you purchase this machine: the manual says that, to clean the frothing wand, hold a cup of water under it and steam the water. I've found this isn't really sufficient. But we keep a clean toothbrush near the machine, and if you scrub the frother a little WHILE steaming the water, it comes clean quite well.
